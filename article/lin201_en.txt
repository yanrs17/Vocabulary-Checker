Welcome to LIN201! Introduction Syllabus
Coming up next time

Introduction
 To start, a bit of background to set the scene.
I grew up in British Columbia and I speak Canadian English as a first language. The fact that I was born in Canada occurred for two different reasons.

  2
Introduction
 My ancestors on my father’s side were Eastern Europeans who fled their homelands around 1910. They were being mistreated for their minority religion and were refugees/immigrants.
My ancestors on my mother’s side were from Great Britain and arrived much earlier – the mid-19th century – for quite a different reason. They were settlers who were given farmland/homesteads in the New World.

  2
Introduction
 In a sense, that encapsulates what Canada is.
We often pride ourselves on embracing people from all over the world and being inclusive and helpful...

  2
Introduction
  
  2
Introduction
 ..but this is also one of many countries that owes its existence to modern European settler-colonialism (French and English).

  2
Introduction
 I do intend for this to be a fun course!
But I also want to acknowledge that Canadian English (along with Canadian French) can’t be divorced from its historical origins.
English is in North America to this extent because some English speakers from the homeland (the British Isles) decided to put colonies here.

  2
Introduction
  
  2
Introduction
 Canada is not the only settler-colonial state resulting from European imperialism.
English is not the only language that has been spread through the modern world in this way.
But the export of English to North America did not occur in a vacuum. The effects on the Indigenous population endure to this day.
To be clear, this is not about guilt, or me trying to be really downbeat and heavy-handed.
It is about awareness and where we currently stand.

  2
Introduction
 I learned in adulthood that I had not been taught Canadian history very well.
I was led to believe that Europeans sailed over, sort of politely shook hands with the locals, and that was that.
(Some of our sources also take this kind of position on our First Nations people.)
This is an inaccurate and romanticized view.

  2
Introduction
 Kent Monkman, The Scream

  2
Introduction
 Today, “only 15% of those who identify as Indigenous speak an Indigenous language more often than they speak English or French. Indeed, of the more than 60 Indigenous languages reported in the 2011 Census, only six have more than 10,000 speakers: Cree (83,475), Inuktitut (34,110), Ojibwe (19,275), Dene (11,860), Innu/Montagnais (10,695), and Oji-Cree (10,180)”
(Denis and D’Arcy 2018:6).

  2
Introduction
 “What these figures underscore is that the vast majority of Indigenous languages spoken in Canada are severely endangered – a direct consequence of nineteenth- and twentieth-century government policies that framed Indigenous languages as primitive, as barriers to civilization...that prohibited their use” (Denis and D’Arcy 2018: 6).

  2
Introduction The take-away message is not that Canadian English is
bad or that speakers of it are supposed to feel ashamed.
It’s that English isn’t here by accident, and that its success was part of a plan. The effects are not confined to the past.
Like Canada, the story of Canadian English is a story of two major elements: settler-colonialism (which is exploitative by nature) and, much more recently, immigration from all over the world.
As a result, it’s often a story about white people, and most of it is told by white people, and the angles on the Indigenous population can be cursory, dismissive, condescending, inaccurate, or all of the above.
 
  2
Introduction
 But we’re at an interesting time in Canadian history where awareness/acknowledgment of Indigenous perspectives is growing among the non-Indigenous population.
“I’ve never witnessed such goodwill as I do now, across the country. The will to start teaching the real history of the country is there. There’s inclusion, in terms of traditions and language. Where we [once] got punished for speaking our language, now we’re encouraged. It’s a different time, and I’m very happy that I’m still here to witness this.”
Alanis Obomsawin (1932–), Abenaki filmmaker, in a 2018 interview with the Globe and Mail.

  2
Introduction
 “The stories of [the residential school] experience are sometimes difficult to accept as something that could have happened in a country such as Canada, which has long prided itself on being a bastion of democracy, peace, and kindness throughout the world. [...] But, shaming and pointing out wrongdoing were not the purpose of the Commission’s mandate. Ultimately, the Commission’s focus on truth determination was intended to lay the foundation for the important question of reconciliation. Now that we know about residential schools and their legacy, what do we do about it? [...] Reconciliation is not an Aboriginal problem; it is a Canadian one.”
(Preface, Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, 2015, pages V-VI).

  2
Introduction
  
  2
Introduction ...which is the opposite in many ways of the goals of
settler-colonialism.
This is not a class about Indigenous languages, but the land was full of Indigenous languages when French and English arrived, and maybe someday it will be again!

  2
Introduction
 Okay. Let’s talk about Canadian English.

  2
Introduction
 Whether you are Canadian or not, a native English speaker or not:
What are some stereotypes about Canadian English or about how Canadians use language?
In other words, what are some   of Canadian English?
 linguistic stereotypes

  2
Introduction Stereotype #1. We say ‘eh?’ a lot.
     
  2
Introduction
 Or is it like this parody graph?
 
  2
Introduction
  Stereotype #2. ‘Oot and aboot’.
  Bizarro
Rhymes With Orange

  2
Introduction
 Stereotype #3. We apologise for everything (and/or are absurdly polite in general).
 Kate Beaton, Hark! A Vagrant

  2
Introduction
   Independence Day (1996) Internet parody

  2
Introduction
  
  2
Introduction
 So. Do we say ‘eh?’ a lot?
This one’s a maybe. It seems to depend on the speaker’s
age and/or where they’re from in Canada.
Younger people in the GTA don’t seem to be using ‘eh?’
much at all.
Derek Denis (UTM) recently had his LIN451 students record conversations with their friends. At the end, there was only one example of ‘eh?’ in the entire data-set and it was from Derek himself.
But ‘eh?’ seems well-established in rural Ontario (Suss 2016). We’ll come back to this in mid-October.

  2
Introduction
 How about ‘oot and aboot’? This one is about half true.
No one really says ‘oot’ or ‘aboot’. But (some) Americans are reacting to a difference in pronunciation.
Almost all Canadian English speakers start the vowels in ‘out’ and ‘about’ higher in the mouth than (some) Americans do.
It’s not as extreme as ‘oot’, but it does sound distinctive. More details on October 1!

  2
Introduction
 And what about saying ‘sorry’ all the time, or being really polite?
Uncertain. This hasn’t been studied in a lot of detail! Some examples of challenges:
a) How much of it is shared with the U.K.? b) It’s a bit difficult to quantify politeness.
c) The same word might be polite in one country and neutral in another.
Maybe you could come up with an interesting new way of studying this as your final project! ☺

  2
Introduction
 One more thought experiment to get things started in terms of the surroundings for Canadian English.
Let’s say we disregarded English and French entirely. Aside from those, what would be the most commonly spoken languages in each province?
(A moment to think about it...)

  2
Introduction
 This is what one graph on the Internet thinks.
 
  2
Introduction
 Languages by the (relative) number of people in Canada who speak them as first languages:

 
  2
Introduction
  Official languages:
 Indigenous languages:
English and French.
languages of the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples.
or immigrant languages: All the rest. Like English and French, brought here from another part
of the world.
the place where a language originated (and where there is usually a large speaker base).
Canada is the homeland only in the case of Indigenous languages.
 Heritage languages
 Homeland:

  2
Introduction
 So many languages are spoken in Toronto!
(Studies have different geographical definitions of ‘Toronto’, so the numbers might not always match up.)
How many languages are there in our classroom?

 
  2
Introduction
 Some Toronto neighbourhoods show clustering of people with a certain background, and others are more of a mix.

 Toronto Star, 2007

  2
Introduction
 Has Toronto English begun sounding divergent in different areas as a result of language contact between English and all these heritage languages?
This is a big question, a great question – and a question that still requires a lot of research.
We’ll find out later in the semester (in mid-to-late November) what some of the first steps towards an answer might look like.
 
  2
Introduction
 Now let’s talk about the first few readings.

  2
Introduction J. K. (Jack) Chambers (1938-) (University of Toronto)
Basically the grandparent of the U of T’s Department of Linguistics and a pioneer of the study of Canadian English since the early 1970s.
Trained in theoretical syntax, became interested in dialectology.
Has worked on an enormous range of topics in language variation and change.
...and my neighbor on the fourth floor! ☺
  
  2
Introduction James Walker (1968-) (La Trobe University)
A sociolinguist trained at the U of T and the University of Ottawa.
Has worked on Toronto English across racial/ethnic/cultural back- grounds, English in Québec, and English creoles in the Caribbean.
Now based in Australia, but still
a key figure in the linguistic study of Canadian English.
  
  2
Introduction The Reverend A. Constable Geike (1821-1898)
A Scottish minister and writer. Poor vision meant he had to abandon his studies and move to Canada.
He was a journalist and commentator and noted for being witty and charismatic.
He did not think very highly of how English was spoken in Canada in the 19th century,
as we will see.

Syllabus
 Some crucial points:
There is a prerequisite for this course: one introductory class in linguistics (LIN100, LIN101, LIN102, or LIN200).
This is primarily of importance because we will be using phonetic symbols (and talking about phonology).
If you are new to the International Phonetic Alphabet or if it’s been a while, check out this clickable IPA chart with sound: http://www.yorku.ca/earmstro/ipa/
...and my handout on (standard) Canadian English phonetics on Quercus.
Let me know if you want to meet for review!

Syllabus
 All course material (lectures, textbook, film clips) is potentially testable, and the final exam will be cumulative (i.e. will include everything from the whole course).
No midterm.
There is a final project that will entail a proposal, a short/informal presentation to the class, and a final essay. The proposal is graded but worth a small proportion of the final mark (5%).
Please note that group work is permitted for the project (including the proposal and presentation), but not otherwise in this class.

  3
Syllabus
 As we’ve already seen, Toronto and the U of T are highly multicultural. A large class is guaranteed to have a large mix of student backgrounds in it.
Let me know if you have any accessibility needs or any concerns about the classroom environment.
If something about the class is making you feel unwelcome, or there are small changes I could make that would help a lot, please talk to me.

  3
Syllabus
 Every semester there are students who plagiarize. Sometimes it is intentional and sometimes it is not – but it is always an infraction. It is unacceptable.
Do not share your homework assignments or ask classmates for theirs.
Do not bring unauthorized aids into the exam. TAs are excellent at spotting these.
In your project proposal and presentation and essay, all ideas and quotations from sources other than your brain must be properly cited and referenced (we will go over how to do this).

  3
Syllabus Desperation often drives students to cheat rather than
admit they don’t understand (or were procrastinating).
It is always MUCH better to hand in an incomplete assignment, or do very poorly on a test, rather than plagiarize.
Getting a low grade can be embarrassing, but plagiarizing is unethical.
I am very happy to help if you need assistance, but if we see evidence of plagiarism/cheating, we are required to take it very seriously.
 
  3
Syllabus
 A special note for speakers of English as a second or other language:
You are very welcome to take this class!
But please be warned that this class is not specifically
about learning how to speak English in Canada.
The ELL has additional resources if you would like to practice your English.☺

  3
Syllabus
 Illness/injury: If you are unwell or injured and likely to miss a quiz, midterm, or deadline, let me know as soon as possible.
I will need proper documentation if the quiz or deadline is already in the past.
Non-medical emergencies such as family situations should be addressed through your college registrar.

  3
Syllabus The last day you can add this course is September 19.
The last day you can drop it is November 5.
Auditors: if you are a U of T student, you are absolutely welcome to sit in on the class. Talk to me if you’d like to attend a tutorial as well.
If you are not a U of T student, the Department of Linguistics will require you to pay a fee to sit in on this course.
 
  3
Syllabus
 A note about language change:
This is a linguistics class, and linguistics is the scientific
study of how languages work.
It is common for writers to worry about languages ‘falling
apart’ or ‘decaying’.
Linguists see language change as natural, neutral, and inexorable. Every natural language is changing all the time, and there is no evidence that any language is becoming more ‘foolish’ over time.
You will still need to try to write clearly and concisely for this class, though. ☺

  3
Syllabus
  Reading to Write (R2W)
This class is part of an Arts and Science initiative aimed at helping undergraduates learn to work with academic journal articles.
Early on, we will be using sections from a textbook (Walker 2015).
As the semester goes on, we will read more and more journal articles and do related activities.

  3
Syllabus
 A note about asking for help:
My job is to teach this class, and I love my job. Seriously.
I’m totally happy to explain things, re-explain things, re- re-explain things, suggest learning strategies, just talk about language in general, anything.
If you get an A in this course as a result of asking for help, you deserve it exactly as much as someone who gets an A on their own.
Asking for help is a resource available to you.

 Announcement #1: Prerequisites
I received a notification that not everyone enrolled in this class has the prerequisites completed.
I am okay with this, but if you have not already taken a class with an introduction to phonetics, you will need some extra assistance – please have a look at the resources on Quercus and/or ask me for help if need be.
(I am also teaching LIN101 this semester so I’m happy to send some extra materials to you on request.)

Announcements Announcement #2: Looking for note-takers!
Accessibility Services is looking for at least one peer note- taker for this class.
One or more of the students in this class have disabilities or other circumstances that mean they would benefit substantially from having copies of good notes taken in this class (either manual or digital).
Here’s what their announcement says...

 Announcement #3: Digital device policy
Read more about it in the syllabus, but:
Digital devices are fine. Some students need these (for accessibility reasons or because that’s what works best otherwise). We’ll also be doing interactive digital polls!
Two strong suggestions:
1. Make an effort to pay attention as much as you can. 2. Try to avoid distracting classmates. Thanks!

Announcements Announcement #4: A reminder about class material
Please do not share copies of my slides with people who are not enrolled in LIN101 this semester.
They’re my intellectual property, but I share them with you on a sort of honour system.
Many thanks!

Announcements Announcement #5: Disabilities and other learning needs
You can absolutely talk to me if you have a disability or some other set of circumstances for which a little bit of extra logistical planning would help a lot. ☺
I have a special learning need: my memory for faces is mediocre. Even with smaller classes, when I run into my students outside class, I generally don’t recognise them.
Please know that if this happens, I’m not ignoring you! My brain just doesn’t realise that I know you. You’re welcome to say hi and let me know you’re in my class!

 Announcement #6: Student survey.
This is an optional and ungraded survey: you can fill out as little or as much of it as you want. I will keep the answers confidential and shred them at the end of the semester.
It lets me learn a bit more about who is in the class and what the range of linguistic/geographic experiences have been.
I’m going to use the survey as attendance today, but if you’re uncomfortable doing the survey and want to be recorded as present, email me or talk to me – no problem!

History of Canadian English
 There have been Europeans in North America since early Viking settlements in Newfoundland from between 990 and 1100 CE. But there seems to have been a large gap between that and John Cabot in 1497.
The French, then the English, set up multiple colonies in what is now Canada in the 16th century. England was more aggressive about it.
England wrestled a lot of territory away from France in the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763).
The only remaining French possession near Canada is Saint-Pierre et Miquelon.

 
  2
(1756-1783).
Some of the people living in the United States were not supportive of the revolution. They wanted to stay loyal to the British crown.
Many of them fled to British North America (now Canada) as refugees amidst the American Revolution.
We now call these people   (or just Loyalists).
The ones from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York brought their dialect of English with them.
History of Canadian English Shortly later came the American Revolutionary War
 United Empire Loyalists

  2
History of Canadian English
 Britain helped resettle the Loyalists – mostly in Ontario, some in the Maritimes (including a population of Black Loyalists, though they were not treated well there).
The Americans invaded the much smaller British North America in 1812 and assumed there would be easy victory, but the British managed to hold them off.

  2
History of Canadian English
 However, as a result of the influx of Loyalists, especially the ones from around New York City, Canadian English started sounding a lot like American English of the time.
The Canadian government was not thrilled about this and recruited a large number of people from Britain as schoolteachers and everyday citizens, hoping to un- Americanize the country a bit.
This had some effect on vocabulary and spelling.
But thanks to the Loyalists, the pronunciation of Canadian English still sounded more American than British in most places. This is true to this day!

  2
History of Canadian English
 In 1867, the colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Québec (Lower Canada), and Ontario (Upper Canada) united in Charlottetown to form the Dominion of Canada.
When the Canadian West was settled by Europeans, it was mostly people setting out from Ontario.
The Ontario dialect (very Loyalist) was spread across the West, including to lots of new settlements.
As in biology/genetics, a   (Mufwene 1996) means that a small establishing population tends to leave long-ranging and dramatic effects on the descendents.
founder effect

  2
History of Canadian English
 These days, dialect maps of North America tend to assume that most of Canadian English sounds the same.
Another way of saying this is that Canadian English has a reputation for being very homogeneous. Many of our readings mention this.
Consider this map from the Atlas of North American English, a huge dialectology project (Labov et al. 2006:148).

 
  2
History of Canadian English
 Dialects of urban and middle-class Canadian English between Victoria and Ottawa do sound a lot alike, and Loyalist roots spread from Ontario to B.C. have a lot to do with that.
But still understudied are:
• rural dialects
• blue-collar speakers
• English up north in the territories
• small differences between large cities • subtle influences of social factors

  2
History of Canadian English
 And in more recent decades, Canada has often (not always, but often) welcomed refugees from all over the world.
Around 1900, it was mostly Central/Eastern/Northern Europeans, and many of them went to the Prairies to farm.
After the Second World War, Canada took in a lot of people from a lot of countries all over the world.

  2
History of Canadian English
 I would not quite call Canada ‘post-colonial’ – we need to undo more of the harm caused to the Indigenous population before we’ve earned that title.
However, with several generations of people here from all over the world, the country’s French/British colonial roots are less obvious than they were.

  2
History of Canadian English
 For a while in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was important for upper-class Canadians of European descent to sound more British than the common people.
This resulted in an accent/affectation now called Canadian Dainty.
Everyday Canadians of the mid-20th century laughed it off as sounding pompous and silly and needlessly aristocratic; Canadian Dainty is now a thing of the past.

History of Canadian English
 Notes about this film:
It is 14 years old and slightly outdated in places. (So that you’re aware, there is a little bit of adult humour and a small amount of profanity.)
It’s comprehensive for 45 minutes and lets us meet a few of the people whose work we’re reading (notably Jack Chambers, Charles Boberg, and Sali A. Tagliamonte).
For review, the least important parts of this film are about spelling and intonation. I’m not going to go into any more detail about those, or ask you about them.

SOCIOLINGUISTICS CONCEPT OF THE WEEK:
Sociolinguistic variables
Variables
 
  3
Variables
  What is a sociolinguistic variable?
Roughly, a variable is a set of two or more ways of saying
the same thing.
couch
sofa
davenport
chesterfield
divan
settee

  3
Variables
 (VARIABLE)
  [variant]
[variant]
(other variants)
[variant]
[variant]
(THREE-SEATED FURNITURE UNIT)
(other variants)
[chesterfield]
    [couch]
[sofa]
[davenport]

  3
Variables
 A linguistic variable might be...
lexical: different words for the same item or concept
(couch/sofa/davenport; pop/soda/soft drink)
syntactic: different sentence structures for the same thing
(Marisa gave Matt the book/Marisa gave the book to Matt) morphological: different forms of affixes and/or inflection
(I sneaked back into the room/I snuck back into the room) phonological: different pronunciations for the same term
(-ing/-in’; -t/-d/etc.)
discourse-pragmatic: share a conversational function (and stuff like that/and that sort of thing/and so on)

  3
Variables
 Note #1: different pronunciations of the same word are a lexical variable. Phonological variables have to apply across lots of different words.
Note #2: spelling differences are not really a variable; dialectologists are much more interested in spoken language.

  3
Variables
 One of the key ideas about variables is that we need to use proportions.
This is a good idea in science and social science in general!

  3
Variables
 For instance:
<deliberate bad reasoning>
I got a flu shot in October 2017.
I got the flu in December 2017.
Therefore the flu shot is ineffective and I shouldn’t get it anymore.
</deliberate bad reasoning>
The problem: we only have one data point! We’re not looking at the broader context.

  3
Variables
 Let’s fix that:
<better reasoning>
I got the flu shot in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017.
I got the flu in 2017 but not in any of those other years.
Therefore the flu shot failed me only 9.1% of the time and I should keep getting it.

  3
Variables
 The same is true of looking at variables.
We can’t study only examples of the variant we’re interested in.
We need to look at their behaviour opposite all of the other variants.
We need proportions (= rates).
This is sometimes called the Principle of Accountability.

Variables
     [couch]

(other variants)

  3
457 times!”
That doesn’t mean anything on its own – it isn’t scientifically responsible. We have to look at all of the tokens (examples) of all of the variants, including the unusual ones (‘divan’, ‘settee’).
We can say:
“People in our study said couch 457 times, but out of a total of 760 times that they talked about a three-seated furniture unit. So they said couch 60.1% of the time.”
Variables

Canadian English vocabulary
 Geike (1857) was not thrilled about how English was being spoken in Canada. But on the plus side, he introduced the term ‘Canadian English’.
Both of our recent readings on Canadian words – Geike (1857) and Avis (1967) – show their age now in two respects:
1. The writing is old-fashioned; and
2. Some of the words have become archaic/unfamiliar!

  2
Canadian English vocabulary
 Some reputedly emerging Canadianisms that Geike didn’t like:
first-class (describing a person) dove
donation
boss
rooster
fix
store pantaloons/pants located
bug or lightning bug posted-up (well-read)

  2
Canadian English vocabulary One of those is decidedly anachronistic now (posted-up).
A couple continue as cross-Atlantic differences: ● pants versus trousers
● fix versus mend ● store versus shop
Many of the rest are unremarkable across dialects.
 
  2
Canadian English vocabulary Here is (WORDS FOR TEMPORARILY GIVING) across
the Golden Horseshoe in a map from Dialect Topography. The proportions are in terms of loan (versus lend).
  There is no border effect: it’s as American as Canadian.

  2
Canadian English vocabulary Here is (PAST TENSE OF ‘DIVE’).
The proportions are in terms of dove (versus dived).
Again, we can’t really see the border doing anything.
  
  2
Canadian English vocabulary
 Contrast this with a really major border effect: (ANTI-). Here are the proportions of [ænti] (versus [æntaj]).
 
  2
Canadian English vocabulary Do you put a yod (/j/ glide before /u/) in (AVENUE)?
(I have a lot of yods because Victoria. My friends in undergrad in New York State thought it was weird/amusing.)
  
  2
Canadian English vocabulary And – especially – how do you pronounce (SHONE)?
(I once lost four points on a linguistics midterm for transcribing this word with /ɑ/ in upstate New York.)
  
  2
Canadian English vocabulary
 Geographically, linguistic changes often start in large cities and spread outward depending both on settlement size and distance from the source.
This is sometimes called the   of dialectology (Trudgill 1974; Chambers and Trudgill 1980; etc.).
But political boundaries, as we see, can exert a huge influence!
Gravity Model

  2
Canadian English vocabulary
 Sometimes terms are shared between Canadian and American English (especially e.g. cars, technology, etc.) but not British English.
And other times terms that Canadian and British English both use are less well-known (or unknown) in American English. Barber (2007: 236-241) includes:
anesthetist, annual general meeting, bum (for ‘rear end’), by-election, bylaw, candy floss (cotton candy), detached house and semi-detached house, exercise book, kerfuffle, mat-leave, rejig, return ticket, serviette, staff room, supply teacher, tea towel, and of course zed.

  2
Canadian English vocabulary With that in mind, let’s talk about some pan-Canadian
words and phrases that are seldom/never found outside.
(We’ll save the really specific regional ones for our cross- Canada tour of dialects.)

Canadian English vocabulary
 From her Introduction (Barber 2007:1):
“I had the experience of journalists asking me, ‘But is there really such a thing as Canadian English? Do we really need a dictionary?’, and, perhaps more tellingly, of a casual conversation with someone who opined that if I worked for Oxford University Press, surely I should be interested in ‘proper English, not Canadian English’.”

SOCIOLINGUISTICS CONCEPT OF THE WEEK:
Apparent time
Variables
 
  3
Apparent time
 We see a lot of commonalities (across time, space, cultures) in terms of how language change over time happens.
Generally, with the exception of a few slang words and phrases, new forms don’t just stick around for just a couple of years and then drop off.
Within a variable, a new variant (the
or innovation) catches on and replaces its covariants.
The usual shape of an innovation (in terms of the proportion within the variable) is an
 incoming form
 S-curve.

  3
Apparent time
 An idealized S-curve:
 time going by
 Rate (%) of new variant within a variable

  3
Apparent time
 The rate of the change (i.e. the slope of the S-curve) is low at first, then gets faster in the middle, and finally slows down again.
Most of the time, a change is the result of each new generation of young adults using incoming forms at successively higher rates.
The system changes over time because young people keep advancing the change a little farther.

  3
Apparent time And this is usually completely unconscious.
A generation of young adults does not decide, overtly, that the people born five years earlier use be like at a rate of 85%, so they’d better use be like at a rate of 90% in order for the change to progress.
But we’re not quite sure what they actually do instead such that language change is this regular! So much room for new work here.
 
  3
Apparent time How can we catch language changing?
That is, what can we do in order to get a good look at more than one time-point of the same language?
 
 
  3
Apparent time
 Unfortunately, most of these tend to be off-limits to the scholarly community. Maybe we just can’t get enough funding. What can we do to study language change over time?
Well, we could do a study, waaaaaaaaaaaait, and then do another study. (That’s called a real time study.)
But let’s say we’re impatient and want a range of data now...
 
  3
OPTION 1
Find some really old language data spanning a period of time!
● old oral history projects
● old radio programs, TV shows, newspapers, etc.
One of our recent alumni (Shayna Gardiner, Ph.D. 2017) studied language change in Ancient Egyptian texts. And guess what she found? S-curves!
Apparent time
  
  3
Apparent time
 OPTION 2
Collect new data, but use people from a range of
ages. That is, assume that age is a proxy for time. This is called the apparent time approach.
  
  3
Apparent time
 We assume that after about the age of 20, people’s use of language tends to stay the same. That means that a 90-year-old talks about the same way that a 20-year- old did 70 years ago.
This is not true 100% of the time, but it seems to work well enough for apparent time to be mostly reliable. Apparent time is not perfect, but it is pretty good.

  3
Apparent time
 We can use this to look back in time, in a sense. It’s much more convenient than trying to find old data.
It also means we can balance a speaker sample (i.e. include a mix of genders, social classes, ethnic/racial/cultural backgrounds, etc.).
And it means we tend to get better casual data if we want to study informal language (sometimes called the vernacular).
  
  3
Apparent time
 So we assume that individuals don’t change much after the age of 20, but every subsequent age cohort moves change forward.
The community changes, but individuals stay stable.
This is what we call generational change: change that happens through successive years of birth gradually moving an innovative form forward.
Younger and older speakers sound very different because they are at different points along this change.
 
  3
Apparent time
 I wrote my MA thesis (and then, in far more detail, my Ph.D. thesis) on structures such as:
It seems like there’s a problem here.
Like is the innovative form. People used to say
It seems as if or
It seems as though or
It seems that or
It seems Ø there’s a problem here.

  3
Apparent time
 In 2011, my 95-year-old paternal grandmother asked me what I was writing my MA thesis on.
I told her it was about the emergence of structures such as It seems like there’s a problem here.
She looked at me aghast and said,
“I don’t speak like that!”
...generational change.

  3
Apparent time This S-curve is with respect to real time.
  time going by
 Rate (%) of new variant within a variable

  3
Apparent time Change in apparent time often shows one big
difference as compared with change in real time.
It’s the same as real time for everyone over 20, because (we assume) everyone over 20 is still talking the same way as they used to.
The same is not true of the kids and teenagers – their dialects are in flux.
 
  3
Apparent time Children mostly start out talking like their
parents/guardians.
When they start school, children begin sounding like
each other rather than like their parents.
As they enter middle school, they begin to individuate and create an identity apart from their parents (also true of taste in music, clothing, etc.).
A group of teenagers advances an innovative form to rates slightly past those of the previous teenagers.
Around age 20, everyone’s dialects stabilize.
 
  3
Apparent time Often when we look at a change in apparent time,
there is something called an
Tagliamonte and D’Arcy (2009) on discourse like:
  adolescent peak.
  
  3
Apparent time
 Sometimes we study a variable in a population and discover there is no change occurring!
Example: D’Arcy and Tagliamonte (2010:393) on relative clause markers in Toronto English in contexts such as:
This is the group _____ I saw last night.

 In this case we don’t have linguistic change: what we have is
This variable is stable over time in this population. It has fallen into a state of equilibrium.
Some variables have been stable for centuries or longer! Example: (ING) being either [ing] or [in].
[in] has always been less formal, but neither one has won out over the other one over time.

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Boberg (2010:124):
“Differentiation of national varieties of English in terms of phonemic inventory mainly concerns vowels rather than consonants: there are no systematic differences between the consonant inventory of [Standard Canadian English] and that of either [Standard British English] or [Standard American English].”

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
  * North American allophone of /t/ and /d/. More on this very shortly.
*
ɹ

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Perhaps the closest thing to a consonant phoneme that exists in some dialects of English but not others: /ʍ/ (a voiceless labiovelar glide). Sometimes transcribed /hw/.
Has been vanishing from Canadian, American, and British English (generational change). Old system:
wʍ wail whale witch which wine whine
Still found in a few speakers in Canada and the U.S., and in a few pockets in the U.K., including Stewie Griffin. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Nae9L4EdRs
  
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 /t/ VARIATION

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
  For most speakers of Canadian English, /t/ and /d/ between vowels neutralise to the allophone [ɾ], except at the beginning of a stressed syllable. Also very frequent in the United States.
t-flapping:
<butter> <battle> <ladder>
/bʌtər/ [bʌɾəɹ] /bætəl/ [bæɾəl] /lædəɹ/ [læɾəɹ]
This is an old feature on this side of the Atlantic Ocean.
“[A]lready normal [in Canadian English] at the end of the nineteenth century” (Boberg 2017:384).

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Some other dialects of English treat /t/ between vowels differently.
Some dialects of British English have [th] and/or [ʔ]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVnrq-6GnY
Grand Rapids, Michigan also has [ʔ], as [kiʔən] is going to show us: https://youtu.be/Pqhy2ejuGLU?t=182
Note that there is variation even within Canadian English in /t/ before syllabic /n/ (as in ‘Keeton’, ‘mitten’, ‘button’, ‘Eaton centre’, etc.). I have an unreleased /t/ there. Some speakers use [ɾ] or a [th].
  
  2
Canadian English pronunciation And /t/ after /n/ has a way of disappearing in many
dialects of Canadian and American English. Especially obvious where it helps indicate localness.
  
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
  
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 (One more slightly more irreverent take on the same observation can be found in today’s lecture-end slide.)

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 /ɹ/ VARIATION

  2
Canadian English pronunciation /ɹ/ (voiced alveolar approximant)
Whether it is pronounced in a syllable coda varies systemically between dialects, and sometimes within individual speakers.
Dialects of English that pronounce those tokens of /ɹ/ are called   dialects: they have rhoticity or are “r-full” (sometimes “+r”).
Dialects of English that do not pronounce those tokens of /ɹ/ are called non-rhotic dialects: they do not have rhoticity. They are “r-less” (sometimes “-r”).
Going back and forth = variable rhoticity.
 rhotic

  2
Canadian English pronunciation Canadian English is rhotic. Almost everyone pronounces
all those syllable-coda /ɹ/s.
Most dialects of American English, Scottish English, Irish English, and southwestern England are also rhotic.
 
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Non-rhotic dialects usually either extend the length of the vowel or put in a schwa after it
Spelling <pear> <your>
Rhotic [pɛɹ] [jɔɹ]
Non-rhotic [pɛ:] [pɛə] [jɔ:] [jɔə]
 Non-rhotic dialects of English: most of southern England (especially hyper-standard Received Pronunciation), South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Boston, New York City, and the American South.
 
 
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 In Shakespeare’s day (late 16th/early 17th century), the English of southern England was still rhotic.
After the initial colonisation of North America, southern England became very non-rhotic.
The colonies were either rhotic or non-rhotic depending on where the settlers came from and when. Most of North America was settled by English speakers early enough that southern England was not yet rhotic.

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
  But! Southern-English English quickly took on (= perception of correctness/elegance) in Canada.
Canadian Dainty, the elites’ dialect that was imitative of Southern-English English, was not rhotic.
prestige

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Check out this short 1973 video of author and U of T professor Robertson Davies (1913-1995), who founded Massey College, talking with a CBC interviewer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXLHaMh1cDo
Two things to listen for:
Davies uses Canadian Dainty: frequent non-rhoticity and
minimal flapping of /t/ or /d/.
The interviewer sounds much more standardly Canadian, but this was long enough ago that he still has /ʍ/.
 
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Canadian Dainty is now a thing of the past, in large part because only a minority of speakers were using it and most Canadians found it pompous and pretty ridiculous. It quickly took on stigma and vanished.
Chambers (2010:27): "Social class is scarcely noticed in novels set in anglophone Canada, except for the early novels of Robertson Davies, which are unconvincingly Canadian anyway because they are so freighted with late- Victorian British conventions and pretensions.“
(Note: not a comment on the literary merit of Davies. Just on how he used language early on.)

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 VOWEL VARIATION

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Standard Canadian English has 14 vowels:
 
  2
Canadian English pronunciation Vowels show more divergence between dialects of
English around the world.
Two changes that occurred in southern England in semi- recent centuries:
1. Split between FOOT and STRUT vowels (Wells 1982’s lexical sets) – happened before colonisation, so Canadian English shares it with southern England. (Never reached northern England – all [ʊ] there.)
 
  2

 2. Split between TRAP and BATH vowels – happened after colonisation of North America so we do not have it here.
The BATH class is pronounced with a so-called ‘broad A’ (a back low vowel) in southern English English.
Did make it to South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

Canadian English pronunciation
 On the other hand, almost all Canadians merge LOT and THOUGHT (the same thing as the cot-caught merger or the
Before colonisation, the LOT and THOUGHT vowels both moved towards the low back section of the vowel-space. (LOT was higher, and THOUGHT was a diphthong.)
 low back vowel merger).

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 They were not quite merged in English English, but they have stuck together like a pair of magnets in Canadian English, as well as parts of New England, Florida, Texas, and much of the American West.
The Northern Cities Vowel Shift distinguishes them by fronting LOT (by...a lot). The American South distinguishes them by diphthongising THOUGHT.

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Early on in Canadian English, LOT and THOUGHT were not entirely merged either.
But the merger seems to have happened very early, maybe even in the mid-19th century (Boberg 2010:128).
Some speculation that the merged system was a Loyalist import from the U.S. that nudged Canadian English to a low back vowel merger (Chambers 1993).
By the 1970s, reports of widespread merger: Scargill and Warkentyne (1972) and Avis (1973).

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 But almost all Canadians pronounce these the same as a result:
cot stock collar
caught /ɑ/ stalk /ɑ/ caller /ɑ/
Possibly a few subtle traces of unmerged LOT and THOUGHT in the Maritimes/Newfoundland?

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 A few other things to note about vowels in Canada:
GOOSE – the /u/ vowel – is becoming very central/front for most Canadian English speakers. Recent change in progress (Boberg 2017:391).
Yods – /j/ glides before /u/ and/or /ʊ/ - are declining in Canadian English, but there are still more in Canada than in the United States. More on this when we get to B.C.
 
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Most Canadians have /owɹ/ in stressed <or>: <sorry>, <orange>, <majority>, <Florida>, etc. Some Americans have a lower vowel here (Chambers 1998, Boberg 2010:133).
Most Canadians say words such as <secretary>, <mandatory>, and <obligatory> with <secondary> stress before the final syllable.
(Your professor is a funny exception, maybe because she’s from a super-British part of Canada – apologies.)
   
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Polysyllable words ending in –ile are more likely to be /ɪl/ or /əl/ in the U.S. and more likely /ajl/ in Canada.
But there’s plenty of variation between words and individuals!
<missile> <tactile> <juvenile> <fertile> <mobile>, <docile>, <futile>, <senile>, etc. (Boberg 2010:141).
Anti- and semi- tend to have /i/ rather than the more American /aj/ (Boberg 2010:141).

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
  CANADIAN RAISING

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 In the autumn of 2007 I took my first sociolinguistics course. There were 15 students present. Professor Whitman walked in and pretty much immediately said, “Do we have any Canadians in the room?”
Indeed. And he got me to pronounce sight and sighed, and we spent most of that first class analysing my accent.

  2
Canadian English pronunciation Canadian raising (CR):
“the pattern whereby the low [diphthongs], [aw] and [aj], have non-low nuclei before voiceless obstruents”
(Boberg 2010:149).
 Not raised: [aj] or [aw]
loud
to house (verb) side
spies
rider
Raised: [ʌw] or [ʌj]
lout
a house (noun) sight
spice
writer
 
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 The term ‘Canadian raising’ was coined by Chambers (1975), but it seems to be a very old phenomenon in Canadian English (Boberg 2010:149, 2017).
Might be a retention of an earlier pronunciation of English English?
CR is definitely not limited to Canadian English. But in the United States, in some places it affects /aj/ much more than /aw/, and/or the conditioning environment appears to be slightly different (‘spider’?).
Note that t-flapping produces a voiced consonant - [ɾ] – but this does not block Canadian raising (Boberg 2010:150).

  2
[ʌj] at all.
They tend to hear that something about [ʌw] in particular is higher up than [aw]...and one of the closest reference points is [u].
Canadian English pronunciation
 No one actually says ‘oot and aboot’, as far as I know. But American English speakers often don’t have [ʌw] or

Canadian English pronunciation
 CANADIAN VOWEL SHIFT

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
  The Canadian Shift is a sound change in progress (generational change) occurring in some of the vowels in Canadian English.
It mainly affects the lax vowels, especially towards the front of the vowel-space.
Different analyses describe it slightly differently, but the gist is as follows:

 
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Phoneticians and sociolinguists have noticed that the Canadian Shift is essentially identical to the California Vowel Shift, and it might even be happening in more places than this.
Should it really be called...
...the Elsewhere Vowel Shift? ...the Front-Lax Vowel Shift? ...the Common Vowel Shift? ...the Third Vowel Shift?
I was just at a conference with a panel about this in April. 60 minutes of discussion and nothing was decided. ☺

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 “FOREIGN <a>”

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Boberg (2009) proposed that a class of “foreign <a>” words has established something of a new phoneme in Canadian English.
These are loanwords and names with a written <a>, often pronounced as a central low /a/ in Canadian English.

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 <pasta>, <plaza>, <drama>, <taco>, <lava>, <Halloween>, <Iraq>, <mafia>, <Iran>, <macho>, <spa>, <pajamas>, <mantra>, <llama>, <fiasco>, <Slavic>, <Colorado>, <Nevada>, <avocado>, <panorama> etc.
Canadian English otherwise doesn’t have a central low vowel (between /æ/ and /ɑ/). So it’s aberrant, but that’s also a gap in the vowel-space for something to fill.
                    
  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 Note: your instructor’s own dialect does not demonstrate this well; most of those words are very much /æ/, and a few are the back /ɑ/. Ontario speakers tend to be a better example.
This became very obvious to me when I moved to the U.S. (“wait, ’dr[æ]ma’?!”) Sometimes it caused comprehension problems.

  2
Canadian English pronunciation
 A conversation between me (from B.C.) and my hallwaymate AB (from Idaho) in the kitchen on the floor of our dorm in upstate NY, around the end of 2006:
MB: “Yay, pasta!”
AB: “What?”
MB: “Yay, pasta!”
AB: “...what was that?” MB: “[‘jej ‘pæstə]”
AB: * silence *
MB: * thinks *
MB: “...although if you’re American you probably pronounce it [pastə].”
AB: “OH!”

Canadian English morphosyntax
 Morphosyntactic variation and change is my academic home base, especially when it comes to English.
But here’s kind of an awesome thing.
It’s really understudied.
Plenty of work to be done!

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 For instance, there’s an old shared intuition out there about as well at the beginning of a sentence. I’ve been vaguely aware of it for at least a decade.
Barber 2007:13: “Canadians seem more likely than other English speakers to use ‘as well’ at the beginning of a sentence, as in As well, Albertans are very friendly.”
I don’t think this has ever been put to the test!
A lot of the ideas out there about Canadian English morphosyntax amount to ‘...it’s not British English’.

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 TRANS-ATLANTIC DIFFERENCES

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Boberg (2010:160-162): A lot of morphological/syntactic features have been attributed to Canadian English over the years, but they’re a hodgepodge of lexical and morphosyntactic phenomena, and some of those prior impressions might be a bit dubious.
Impressionistically, Canadian English usually follows Standard American English rather than Standard British English when it comes to morphosyntactic features.

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Case in point: modals and auxiliaries. Many more verbs act modal-y in British English (rather than like full lexical verbs). Possessive have is a good example: (examples from Boberg 2010:162):
I haven’t a clue or I’ve not a clue < UK
I don’t have a clue or I haven’t got a clue < North America
I’ve still an old songbook < UK
I still have an old songbook < North America
Have you any wool? < UK
Do you have any wool? < North America

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 The same is true of need and dare, which are more modal in British English (Boberg 2010; see also Duffley 1994, Taeymans 2004).
Need I continue? < UK
Do I have to continue? < North America
Dare I propose a toast? < UK
? Do I dare to propose a toast? < North America

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Shall is basically defunct in North American English, especially the negative contraction shan’t (i.e. ‘won’t’) (see Williams 2014; Denis and Tagliamonte 2018).
The past participle of get is gotten in North America, but got in British English:
He hasn’t got his materials yet. < UK
He hasn’t gotten his materials yet. <North America

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Human collective nouns such as ‘family’, ‘team’, ‘council’, etc. are treated as singular in North America but plural in British English.
His family are concerned about him. < UK
The firm in Manchester are about to sue. < UK
His family’s concerned about him. < North America
The company in Boston is about to sue. < North America

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 British English has “pro-predicate do” (Boberg 2010:164): when a verb undergoes ellipsis, do can stand in its place:
Did you go for a run this morning?
No, but I should have done! < UK
No, but I should have! < North America

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax Second-person plural nouns:
English no longer has its old distinction between singular/plural (or informal/formal) thou/you, thee/you, thy/thine/your.
The old plural forms have become unmarked for number or politeness. They are now ambiguous in many cases.
Excluding moderately formal workarounds such as all of you, dialects tend to come up with their own casual second-person plural words!
Can you think of any?
 
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Y’all: Strongly associated with the American South, but possibly found throughout the rural U.S., and also possibly gaining in popularity? As far as I know, unstudied in Canada!
Yinz or yunz: Pittsburgh: contraction of you ones.
Yous or youse (/yuz/): various places; Atlantic Canada?
Deserving of more study!
You guys: prominent in North America; constant ongoing discussion as to whether it is still gendered/exclusionary or whether it has become semantically bleached.
You lot: a default form in the UK (and maybe Australia).

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 (If you’re curious about little syntactic differences between dialects of North American English, the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project maintains wonderfully compiled descriptions of lots of phenomena they study! For instance: https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/done-my- homework)

Canadian English morphosyntax
  THE DONE MY HOMEWORK CONSTRUCTION

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Boberg (2010:166) tiptoes around it tentatively, but recent years have seen a few sets of authors diving into this construction fearlessly.
I am done my homework. < Canada I am finished my lunch. < Canada
This is unremarkable to most speakers of Canadian English, and utterly bizarre to most others.
American English has to put it into the perfect or use a preposition for it to be grammatical:
I have done my homework. < North America
I am finished with my lunch. < North America

Canadian English morphosyntax
   from Melbourne
 
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 The Yale Grammatical Diversity Project says that the construction is “a widespread characteristic of Canadian English, and it is also found in the United States among speakers in the Philadelphia area, southern New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and the northern part of New England (Yerastov 2008, 2010a, 2010b, 2012, 2016; Hinnell 2012; Fruehwald and Myler 2013, 2015; Zanuttini et al. 2016). It has not been found in the dialects of the United Kingdom or elsewhere outside of North America.”
Yerastov (2012:432) speculates about related transitive-be structures with Scottish/Irish links.

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Yerastov (2012) found that Canadians accept this construction with done, most like it with finished, and a few can use it with started (I’m started my homework).
He calls it “transitive BE perfect”.
Josef Fruehwald and Neil Myler (2015) pick apart the syntax in detail and call it a “stative passive”. It doesn’t quite behave the way a true passive does:
• Accepts ‘all’ (I’m all done my homework)
• Doesn’t always mean the same thing as have done.

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Still plenty of work to be done on this construction. It got no attention at all from academic linguistics before about 2008.
(Two students in LIN201 in Fall 2010 did an experiment testing who accepted this syntactic construction and who didn’t!)
What else is lurking out there waiting to be discovered?

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 EH?

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Two weeks ago we saw that Canadian raising is very commonly associated with Canadian English – to the point of being a stereotype – but is not exclusive to it. Some American dialects use it as well.
This is also the case with eh?.

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Of course, it’s much better-known as an established Canadian thing.
Eh? is a discourse-pragmatic phenomenon: it is not so much a vocabulary item competing with other vocabulary items, but a conversation navigation/management device: a discourse marker (see Wiltschko et al. 2018).
A few studies in the 1970s considered it (Love 1973, Avis 1975, Gibson 1976, Schecter 1979, and some dialectical surveys).
By that point, it was already well-known as a supposedly Canadian word (Denis 2013:4).
It’s not exclusive to Canada...
 
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 The Upper Peninsula of Michigan (the ‘U-P’, i.e. the /ju:pi:/) is close to Canada, but has its own distinctive identity as a place not quite like the ‘mitten’ of Michigan (the southern component of the state).
Locals are called Yoopers (/jupəɹz/).
Here we see that eh? is an established Yooper thing.
 
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 But it’s more popularly known as a Canadian feature. The Yale Grammatical Diversity Project calls it “Canadian eh”.
Indexicality is the idea that a linguistic form indexes (signals/conveys) some characteristic/trait/identity.
“the specific ideological schema by which the meaning of eh was shaped at this time was the [Canada/U.S.] contrast. This is one of the main characteristics of Canadian cultural identity” (Denis 2013:4).
In other words, Canadians latched onto eh? partially in the context of making fun of Americans and distinguishing themselves from Americans.
 
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas picked up on it and used it in their Bob and Doug McKenzie skits on Saturday Night Live. Cemented it as an overtly Canadian thing.
 
   i.e. stereotype territory
 
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 In terms of its functionality, the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project refers to eh? as “similar to standard [American] English don’t you and right, which can be used in: many of the same contexts (Wiltschko and Heim 2016).”
Like those, it is frequently a confirmational: a way of turning an assertion into a question.
You made it to the party after all, eh?
But it can also be appended to something that is already a question:
What the heck were you doing, eh?
 
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax It can be a narrative marker, which provides pauses and a
‘how about that?’ sense partway through storytelling.
So I slept in yesterday, eh, and there’s a scratching at my window, eh, and I look over and there’s a big raccoon trying to mess with the latch, eh, and fortunately it didn’t get in, eh, but later I went to open the back deck and discovered that the raccoon had fallen asleep on its face, eh, while curled up next to the back door.
But that’s not all it can do. As noted by Gold (2004), Gibson (1976) suggests a taxonomy of eight functions of eh? Gold (2004) added a few extra ones (with asterisks):
 
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
  
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
  
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 She tested a lot of LIN101 students and found:
• overwhelming support among students for I know, eh?
• relatively little use of eh? to mean pardon me? but more in Québec than elsewhere, but not a lot of use in this function anywhere.
• “...the use of eh is fairly consistent across Canada...[and] there has been little change in the use of eh over the course of a generation” (Gold 2004:8).

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 But other studies find that recently there has been change – not in how the word eh? is used, but in how frequently it is used.
Derek Denis at UTM is studying Canadian English confirmationals.
Eh is hanging on just fine in rural Ontario (Süss 2016; see also Denis 2013:5, n. 4), but seems to be really noticeably disappearing from cities of Ontario and B.C.
What’s replacing it? Any thoughts?

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 Toronto (Denis 2013:7):
 
  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 A talk he gave on Thursday (Denis 2018) described how “right...accounts for upwards of 75% of confirmational tags among young people in Toronto while eh occurs only 2% of the time.”

  2
Canadian English morphosyntax
 So what happened?
• Did Canadian English get sick of eh?
• Did eh? become so inextricable from rural, blue-collar Canadian identity that the cities started perceiving it negatively?
• Did right undergo grammatical change quickly in North American English and get spread across the border easily?
Or all of the above?
We’ll have to see what the research says!

Newfoundland/Maritimes Today we begin our geographic tour of regional dialects
of Canadian English.
Necessary disclaimer: we’re only scratching the surface of the amount of variety found in each place! This is true with respect to variables, to social groups (class, gender, occupation, racial/ethnic/cultural background, etc.), to apparent time, to levels of formality (style/register), and to intra-regional variation (rural/urban).
For instance, we’re doing one lecture on English in Ontario and Western Canada.

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
We begin in the east. We do this for several reasons:
1. This was Europeans’ first point of contact with North America.
2. There are still dialects here that are quite distinctive relative to ‘standard’ Canadian English.

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
Recall that we’ve heard that Canadian English has a reputation for being homogeneous.
Now have a look at this classic map and spot the exception.

Labrador

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes Why does English in Newfoundland and Labrador
sound so different?
Three intertwined reasons:
1. European settlement was primarily from Ireland and southwestern England: imported regional features.
2. Most of the settlements of Newfoundland and Labrador were very small and remote. There has been relatively little geographic mobility or marrying outsiders.
3. Newfoundland did not join Canada until 1949!

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
Childs and Van Herk (2014:636): “Newfoundland was England’s first overseas colony, first settled in the 16th century. The vast majority of European immigrants came from sharply restrained areas of south-western England...and south-eastern Ireland... [i]mmigration peaked between the 1780s and the mid-1830s, then almost entirely dried up. The following long period of economic and political isolation, combined with the region’s physical isolation, helped Newfoundland English (NE) to retain many traditional features of its input varieties. The variety is both distinct (with many features not found among its neighbouring varieties) and diverse (with individual Newfoundland communities maintaining sharp dialect differences) (Clarke 2005; Handcock 1984; Mannion 1977).”

      2
Newfoundland/Maritimes

     2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
European settlement in this area was essentially a fishing enterprise for Great Britain. Most of the Irish/English settlers were rural, working-class people who were not literate.
https://www.heritage.nf.ca/videos/settler-life-1780- 1840.php
To this day, about half of the population of St. John’s, Newfoundland, is of Irish descent (Kirwin 1993:69).
If there was any use of the Irish language (Irish Gaelic), it did not last in Newfoundland (Kirwin 1993:68). But Irish ways of speaking English have endured.

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
There are a ton of distinctive vocabulary items (and phrases, and idioms) in Newfoundland English. See e.g. the Dictionary of Newfoundland English (Story et al. 1990).
A lot of them are related to local economic activity (fishing), food, and other cultural practises.

Social factors

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
There is often tension locally between traditional Newfoundland practise and identity and more mainstream norms of Canadian English.
St. John’s is the only city, and places where there is overlap between city/supra-local culture and small, rural activity may yield interesting findings.
“Most younger Newfoundlanders have not spent much time outside the province, and are not particularly aware that many features of their speech are not widespread elsewhere” (Childs and Van Herk 2014:642).

Newfoundland/Maritimes

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
This is a region that saw a mix of European settlement.
There is a lot of French in the Maritimes. French colonies in the area were collectively called Acadia, and French- Canadians in the Maritimes often still refer to themselves as Acadians.
Even cities with English-sounding names (e.g. Grand Falls, New Brunswick) may be overwhelmingly Francophone.

    2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
The jokes about New Brunswick are that it’s utterly forgettable.
But linguistically, there’s a whole lot going on.

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
New Brunswick is Canada’s only officially bilingual province. Some areas have very little use of English.
Some studies (Kinloch 1985) are about English in English- speaking New Brunswick.
Some studies (House 1985) are about English in French- speaking New Brunswick.
On top of that, it is the only Maritime province next to the United States, so you get border effects (Burnett 2006).

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
The vowel in ‘father’ is often pronounced [æ] – especially in Fredericton and Saint John (Gardner p.c. 2011).
The [l] in ‘almond’, ‘palm’, etc. might well be retained (Kinloch 1985:66).
Second person plural yous (Kinloch 1985:69) A-prefixing (Kinloch 1985:68-69)
“He was a-hunting.”

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia are just beginning
to be studied in depth (Gardner 2017:4).
Matt Hunt Gardner at St. Mary’s University (who received his Ph.D. in 2017 from here) has been diving into studying Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, which shows influence from Celtic (Irish/Scottish) settlement.
“To this day, one can discern the Scots roots of rural speech in Cape Breton, Pictou and Antigonish counties in Nova Scotia” (Chambers 2004:228).

    2
Newfoundland/Maritimes Slit fricatives are all over the place in Cape Breton Island.
Word-final /t/ and /d/ often get fricated to something like /s/ and /z/. This was a traditional feature that was somewhat lost, then reclaimed (Parris 2009, Gardner 2010, Childs and Van Herk 2014:652).
Might happen with /t/ in Newfoundland as well (Kirwin 1993:74).

   2
Newfoundland/Maritimes
But the problem is that people sometimes overstate the similarity between Cape Breton Island and the Celtic parts of the United Kingdom.
“My own fieldwork on the English of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, reveals a variety that is more or less identical with the English of the Scottish Highlands” (Trudgill 2004).
That does not seem to be evidence-based (Gardner 2017). Even rural Nova Scotia English seems very much in line with Canadian English in most ways (Gardner 2017).

SOCIOLINGUISTICS CONCEPT OF THE WEEK:
Rapid anonymous surveys

Rapid anonymous surveys William (“Bill”) Labov (1927-)
University of Pennsylvania
Founded modern variationist sociolinguistics almost single- handedly in the 1960s.
Has done seminal work on Martha’s Vineyard, New York City, Philadelphia, and AAVE.
Has had tons of students. Didn’t retire until 2014!

Rapid anonymous surveys
Labov 1972: The social stratification of (r) in New York City department stores.
While at Columbia University in the 1970s, Labov thought of a novel way of investigating social class.
He picked three NYC department stores that catered to very different income levels.
● Saks: Wealthy customers ● Macy’s: Middle class
● S. Klein: Budget shoppers

   3
Rapid anonymous surveys
He would go into a store and surreptitiously pick a department located on the fourth floor (e.g. the men’s shoes).
Then he would approach a salesperson and say, “Excuse me, where are the men’s shoes?”
“Fourth floor.”
Then he’d ask for a repetition: “Excuse me?” “Fourth floor.”
Then Labov would go write down whether the salesperson pronounced the four syllable-final Rs!

     3
Rapid anonymous surveys
He did this a bunch of times in each store.
This methodology is often called the rapid anonymous
survey.
‘Rapid’ because it is very quick.
‘Anonymous’ because we don’t know who the salespeople were, beyond the very basics.
‘Survey’ because it was a questionnaire about the salespeople’s language...even if they didn’t know it.

   3
Rapid anonymous surveys
You are permitted to do a rapid anonymous survey!
The catch is that it needs to not inconvenience/upset people any more than everyday interactions would, but you can do it.
And this is only well-suited to a small number of variables (acoustically obvious, clear-cut, very everyday).
(Several LIN351 classes since 2013 have studied variants of what people say in response to ‘thank you’.)

   3
Rapid anonymous surveys
Other methodologies that could work (remember, the details are going into your proposal):
Short written survey (like Dialect Topography) of what people call e.g. a (THREE-SEATED FURNITURE UNIT) and/or whether they use a certain word/structure (needs a consent form – we’ll discuss this).
Interviewing speakers and recording their pronunciation of e.g. foreign-A words (also need consent forms – we’ll discuss this).
Studying Canadian writing (email me if you want to use a big corpus I compiled from Project Gutenberg in 2011).

  2
English in Québec Across Canada, 17.5% of people call themselves bilingual
in English and French.
The rate is much higher in Québec: just over 40%.
That’s mostly because nearly everyone in Québec speaks French.
 
  2
English in Québec
 English does exist in Québec, but only to a certain extent. In terms of what people from call their first language:
80% of Québecers say French 9% of Québecers say English
 (Statistics Canada)

 Labov et al. (2006:148)

  2
English in Québec
 Montreal is sort of just thrown in there with all those places to the west.
The city certainly has a reputation as a place where there’s enough English that you can’t expect to move there and learn French.
But that’s overstating it a bit.

  2
English in Québec
 65% of Montrealers identify French as their first language; 13% say English. Less French here than across Québec, but mostly due to more heritage-language speakers
(cf. Poplack et al. 2006:196) such as Yiddish and Italian.
 (Statistics Canada)

  2
English in Québec
 It definitely used to be more true that Montreal was full of English speakers, and French speakers often struggled culturally and economically.
In 1977,   passed in the provincial legislature. Prior to this, the province did not have any official languages. Bill 101 defined the official language of Québec as French.
Courtrooms, employers, signage, and schools are all subject to the guidelines of Bill 101.
There were some halfhearted exceptions thrown in for First Nations and Inuit languages. And English is taught as a second language almost everywhere. But French is the language used in schools otherwise.
Bill 101

  2
English in Québec
  
  2
English in Québec
 Anglophones in Canada generally despised Bill 101, for various reasons.
Pierre Trudeau disliked it intensely because he wanted to promote French/English bilingualism nationwide.
Many Québec residents still dislike how difficult it is for children to get schooling in English.
Tens of thousands of monolingual English speakers left Québec and settled elsewhere.
So did corporations that operated largely in English.

  2
English in Québec
 This is why the Bank of Montreal moved most of its operations here in 1977. (Rumour has it they almost changed their name after they left.)
 
  2
English in Québec
 Bill 101 led to the creation of the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF), or the so-called ‘language police’.
They enforce rules about French getting to be front and centre in Québec.

English in Québec Nonfictional language-police silliness: “Pastagate” (2013)
This high-end restaurant was told that they were using words such as ‘pasta’ and ‘calamari’, and that those were not French enough.
The owner went public and the OQLF president resigned.
  
  2
English in Québec
 What does all this mean for English in Québec?
• No longer as prevalent.
• No longer politically dominant or as necessary.
• More stigma attached to being monolingually Anglophone in Québec (see Poplack et al. 2006:203-206).
• Still a big part of life in Montreal, but not nearly so much elsewhere. “English has declined substantially in Quebec City” (Poplack et al. 2006:198).

  2
English in Québec
 There is a widespread assumption (McArthur 1989, Poplack et al. 2006, etc.) that English in Québec is full of loanwords (= borrowings) from French and that it is messing with the structure of English locally.
Let’s break that down a bit. (Loanwords/borrowings from French into English are sometimes called gallicisms.)
 
  2
English in Québec
 Is English in Québec full of gallicisms? Well, there are a few.
Boberg (2010:Chapter 4) lists 15-20.

  2
English in Québec
 dépanneur or dep ‘convenience store’
(McArthur 1989:11)
Boberg 2010:173: in France, the word means ‘emergency mechanic’, but in Québec, it has come to mean ‘quick source of assistance and food’.
Compare English ‘pit-stop’.
Boberg 2010:173: dep “has been enthusiastically adopted by Montreal anglophones”.

 But that’s about it. “French lexical items have made virtually no inroads into the [Québec] English lexicon” (Poplack et al. 2006:207).
And the notion that a gazillion French words are affecting the morphosyntax of English in Québec is “an idea with no basis in scientific fact” (Poplack et al. 2006:186).
They happen, but not often, and when Poplack et al. (2006) find examples, they tend to be very deliberate (used knowingly for effect) rather than unconscious.

  2
English in Québec
 Poplack et al. 2006 compare two things: a) English in Québec City, and
b) English outside Toronto (as a control condition, meaning a baseline without the possible effect being studied)
They find few differences. Unlike in Newfoundland and the Maritimes, Québec English seems to be a whole lot like Ontario/Western Canadian English.

  2
English in Québec We’re going to come back to ethnolects (varieties
associated with ethnic groups) in Montreal.
Recall from the Talking Canadian video that the Italian and Jewish populations of Montreal are:
a) internally cohesive
b) fairly self-contained (leading to dialect divergence!) c) both English-speaking populations with lots of surrounding French.
They are insular, and not just because Montreal is an island. ☺

SOCIOLINGUISTICS CONCEPT OF THE WEEK:
The vernacular
The vernacular
 
  3
The vernacular
 What types of language are sociolinguistics interested in? Conceivably, anything!
Someone could study variables in dating ads. Or of British parliamentary transcripts from the 1840s. Or of new words from the Black Twitter community.
(I know scholars who do each of these things!)
But most often, what sociolinguists really want to get at is
 the vernacular.

  3
The vernacular
 The vernacular is a form of language in which people are not paying too much attention to their own use of language. It is casual/informal with as little linguistic self- consciousness as possible. It is usually spoken.
A few definitions of the vernacular:
“the style in which the minimum attention is given to the monitoring of speech” (Labov 1972:208)
“everyday speech” (Sankoff 1974,1980:54! “real language in use” (Milroy 1992:66)

  3
The vernacular
 Poplack et al. (2006:195): English in Québec City is full of “vernacular and colloquial features of English, such as be like quotatives.”

  3
The vernacular
 A lot of data collection in sociolinguistics happens through the sociolinguistic interview (Labov 1984) where an interviewer sits down with a person from the target community and asks them questions for an hour.
A lot of people are uneasy at first.
What are some things (both within the interview approach and outside it) that a sociolinguist could do to make people feel less nervous and more comfortable? That could elicit more vernacular speech?
 
  3
The vernacular
 There is a problem here.
Above all, sociolinguists tend to be the most interested in how people talk when they aren’t being monitored.
But when we interview people to get dialectical data, ethically we have to tell them that we are recording them, and that might make them more self-conscious than we want.
This is called the
 Observer’s Paradox.

  3
The vernacular
 But the best data (in terms of worth and consistency) come from vernacular speech, which is “highly regular” (Labov 1984:29). Everything else has to be interpreted in light of the vernacular. The vernacular is the baseline.

  3
The vernacular
 The goal: two potentially opposing forces:
“...we need a large volume of recorded speech of high enough quality for instrumental analysis of vowels or the precise judgments on the realizations of grammatical particles which are often reduced to rapidly articulated, minimal features of sound. On the other hand, we place a very high value on records of vernacular speech...which show a minimum shift or accommodation of the presence of an outside observer” (1984:29).

  3
The vernacular
 Some questions are particularly well-suited for eliciting long, vernacular narratives:
● the ‘danger of death’ question (a classic);
● “Did you ever get blamed for something you didn’t
do?”
● “Did you ever have a dream that really scared you?” (1984:33).
(The third question abruptly reminded me of a nightmare I had when I was four...)

  3
The vernacular
 Labov mentions that it’s excellent when the interviewer can work in questions about language, in order to see if there are local stereotypes or forms that index particular characteristics.
One of the goals of the interviewer should be nudging the conversation towards the vernacular if it is starting to sound formal.
Using an unobtrusive microphone leads to less self- consciousness.

  3
The vernacular
 An observant/experienced interviewer can spot things that someone likes talking about and/or has a lot of stories about!

English in Ontario and the West
 This is basically the lecture about English in the rest of the country.
Newfoundland has multiple good reasons for being distinctive. The Maritimes as well, to a lesser extent.
Québec? Well, okay, we can talk about it being its own case study because there’s so much French.
English in the Territories? As far as I know, it hasn’t been studied at all.
That leaves us with everything else.

 Labov et al. (2006:148)

  2
English in Ontario and the West
 This is most of the population of Canada. But this is the zone of dialectical homogeneity in English, especially among middle-class people in the cities.
With those disclaimers in mind: why is there homogeneity, to the extent that it exists?
Several overlapping reasons.

  2
English in Ontario and the West 1. History of linked settlement.
We saw that the United Empire Loyalists helped shape the dialects of southern Ontario, and then their descendants settled the West.
The founding populations of a lot of these European settlements were Ontarians, and they sounded Ontarian.
 
  2
English in Ontario and the West 2. Little time for divergence to emerge.
It simply hasn’t been very long since Europeans settled the West. It took a while for white people to get out there.
There is a book out there called “Victoria: A History in Photographs.” As in, there are photos going all the way back to the city’s beginnings, because Victoria is not older than photography.
(Vancouver is bigger but not older than Victoria.)
 
  2
English in Ontario and the West
 What did Toronto look like in the 1860s?
 
  2
English in Ontario and the West
 How about Victoria?
 
  2
English in Ontario and the West 3. Geographic mobility and convergence.
Keeping people apart ensures that their dialects diverge. Having people mix tends to do the opposite.
What would you have had to do to get to British Columbia in the 1850s?
This is still a large country, but travelling is pretty easy now. The railroad, the automobile, heavier-than-air flight.
 
  2
English in Ontario and the West So maybe it’s no surprise that there has been convergence
between Ontario English and B.C. English over time.
“[A]spects of CanE homogeneity appear emergent rather than foundational” (Denis and D’Arcy 2019).
In other words the similarity wasn’t all there in the first place; some of it has been a more recent development.
More broadly, this is called
With that, let’s turn our attention to the Roeder et al. article.
  dialect levelling.

 After Sky’s Ph.D. defense at UVic this past winter.

  2
English in Ontario and the West
 The Roeder et al. (2018) article starts by acknowledging that the Atlas of North American English was a big deal, and Charles Boberg’s work has led to a better understanding of vowels throughout Canada.
But there is still tons of room for detailed case-studies of individual places within Ontario and the West.
Victoria is one of many places where studying change over time will unearth “pathways of change as dialects begin to participate in supralocal patterns of variation” (Roeder et al. 2018:88).

  2
English in Ontario and the West
 The city was simply difficult to get to for a long time. It’s on an island, off the west coast of a province that is mostly giant mountains.
“Regular, year-round ferry service between the peninsula and the Canadian mainland was only established in 1960, the same period when affordable air travel became available” (Roeder et al. 2018:89).
And Victoria was always supposed to be something of an outpost for the British aristocracy. (I grew up in a British neighbourhood and went to Anglican school for 13 years.) Could also help preserve older/traditional features.

  2
English in Ontario and the West
 How typical does Victoria act with respect to: a) the Canadian Vowel Shift?
b) raising of /æ/ before nasals and before voiced velars? (Said to be a particularly Western thing.)
c) fronting of back vowels? (Change in progress, cross- dialectically common, minus the Atlantic provinces.)
d) retraction of the vowel in START? (Stable and supposed to be noticeable, especially in Western dialects.)
e) post-coronal yods before /u/? (Disappearing from Canadian English, but behind American English in this respect.)

  2
English in Ontario and the West
 Lots and lots of word-list examples – almost 10,000.
Not the most casual task, as we saw two weeks ago, and as the authors acknowledge. But it matches Charles Boberg’s work on vowels of young people from all over Canada.
And it serves as a reference point for future studies.
So? How different is Victoria from a bunch of Canadian dialects all thrown in together?

  2
English in Ontario and the West
 
  2
English in Ontario and the West
 Canadian Shift is definitely happening, but might have started later in Victoria than in other parts of the country.
Back-vowel fronting is also definitely happening.
Victoria patterns with B.C. and the Prairies when it comes to raising of BAN and BAG.
The same is true of START (across B.C. and the Prairies, farther back than in the East – Newfoundland START is really front).
There are a lot of yods! More than expected, and not obviously declining in Victoria. Remnant of traditional feature locally?

  2
English in Ontario and the West
 
  2
English in Ontario and the West
 Young people from Victoria sound like young people from all over Western Canada, but with a few extra yods. And the changes that have brought Victoria in line with the rest of the region seem to have happened recently and quickly: there has been “rapid leveling to
supralocal norms among speakers born in the decades after 1940” (Roeder et al. 2018:106).
This is exactly what we would expect given greater geographic connectivity once the ferry service became regular and the airport became better serviced and highways opened up and so on.

  2
English in Ontario and the West
 Now let’s return to Ontario.
We’ll hear more about the present and future of Toronto English in subsequent weeks (lectures, readings, guest speaker, your presentations!).
What’s happening outside the city?

  2
English in Ontario and the West The Ontario Dialects Project has been running out of the
Language Variation and Change Lab here since 2007.
In 2007-2008, the lab studied Belleville, Lakefield, and Burnt River (southeastern towns across several population sizes).
From 2009 to present, the lab has explored all over! First the north of the province along Highway 11 (North Bay to Kapuskasing) and lots of interesting small places from Highway 11 eastward almost to Ottawa.
http://individual.utoronto.ca/tagliamonte/projects.html
  
  2
English in Ontario and the West
 We’ve seen that places with divergent groups of founders at settlement often hang onto some idiosyncratic properties.
As in biology (remnants of a founding population of a species), this is called a founder effect.
The European-settled north of Ontario had a very different economic/social/cultural base. That may lead to some distinctive dialectical features.
The Ottawa Valley is another excellent example.

  2
English in Ontario and the West
 The Ottawa Valley had a considerable amount of early immigration from Ireland in particular.
Like Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, this has left it with a distinctive dialect relative to standard Canadian English.
Whenever we’re writing a paper about rural Ontario and there’s one town out of 11 that’s acting very differently from the others, it’s probably Almonte (the one example in the Ottawa Valley before additional recent fieldwork).
Pringle and Padolsky (1981) call it “a dialect pocket of exceptional interest”.

English in Ontario and the West
 Possible features identified early on by Pringle and Padolsky (1981, 1983):
• No caught-cot merger!
• Word-initial and/or word-final devoicing?
• A few vocabulary items from Gaelic/Scottish
• Very monophthongal, high /o/ phoneme.
• Very fronted START (as in Newfoundland)
• Articulatorily distinct /r/ phoneme?
• Slit fricatives (affricated final /t/ as in Cape Breton) • Palatalization of /k/ and /g/
Lots of variation reported between towns. Founder effects?

SOCIOLINGUISTICS CONCEPT OF THE WEEK:

Independent factors
 We’re already met the sociolinguistic variable (lots of ways of saying the same thing), and its variants. Let’s review that quickly.

Independent factors Here we have a sociolinguistic variable having to do
with a piece of furniture that multiple people sit on.
The different labels for this item are called the variants. They vary with each other (or they co-vary) across space, time, social groups, etc.
When we study linguistic change, we study a new form coming in against the co-variants.
 
  3
Independent factors
      
  3
Independent factors That is the sociolinguistic variable.
Now we’re going to introduce two other possible meanings of the word ‘variable’ (though I’m going to stick to ‘factor’ in an attempt to avoid confusion!).
 
  3
Independent factors
 In general across the sciences (including social sciences)...
...the   (or the dependent variable) in a quantitative study is what we are interested in measuring or testing.
...and the independent factor(s) (or the independent variable[s]) is/are thing(s) that we are analysing the dependent variable in terms of.
We want to examine the effect of the independent factor(s) on the dependent factor.
dependent factor
 
  3
Independent factors
 Our dependent factor is usually the proportion of a sociolinguistic variant opposite all of the variants of the variable together (necessity of calculating rates – Principle of Accountability!).
Our independent factors fall into two categories.
Because this is sociolinguistics, we are interested in social factors and linguistic factors.

  3
Independent factors
 Social factors that we might be interested in, depending on the study: sex/gender, age, ethnic/racial/cultural background, hometown, socioeconomic class, occupation, level of education, level of formality, type of interaction, sexual orientation, friendship network, other group membership, etc.

  3
Independent factors
 Linguistic factors that we might be interested in: position in word/sentence, preceding/subsequent phoneme, word class, clause length, stress placement, number of morphemes, how common the word is in everyday use, and so on depending on the phenomenon.

  3
Independent factors
 Necessarily disclaimer:
Real data is almost always a bit untidy.
Not chaotic, but not quite perfectly well-behaved. That’s just how it is.
Results are almost always influenced by small and/or erratic things. It is difficult to take everything into account.
In both cases, it is crucial to select the independent factors based on hypotheses: based on what you expect to be relevant to the sociolinguistic variable under study.

  3
Independent factors A bit more about some social factors and what they could
tell us.
People united by a characteristic might show shared
linguistic behaviour if...
• they interact with each other a lot
• they share values, loyalties, activities, resources
• the rest of society often treats them in a particular way • they differentiate themselves from other groups
 ...or more!
Next week we’re going to consider clusters of people in Toronto united by racial/ethnic/cultural background.

  3
Independent factors
 For now, let’s talk a bit about language and gender. Acknowledgment: we’re barely going to scratch the surface. You can take an entire course about this here. ☺
Also, we need a disclaimer: sociolinguistics is really behind the times when it comes to studying gender (see Zimman 2018, Konnelly 2018).
Sociolinguistic studies often do little more than have one ‘male’ category and one ‘female’ category.
Western society has caught on to gender being a whole lot more complicated than that.

  3
Independent factors
 Collectively, most Europeans have long since tried to assume that gender is no more than sex and that there are no more than two sex categories. Both of those are scientifically inaccurate and have caused harm – time to put them behind.
Several Indigenous groups speak of how European colonisation led them to mistreat their Two-Spirited individuals.
https://www.nfb.ca/film/first_stories_two_spirited/
 
  3
Independent factors
 Gender is much more complicated than sociolinguistics often assumes. It is multifaceted – includes several axes:
● Gender identity: Internal sense of what fits.
● Gender expression: Outward appearance.
● Biological sex: Chromosomes, hormones, genitalia, etc.
And it sometimes intersects with:
● Sexual orientation: Romantic/sexual attraction.
Each one of these four is a spectrum, and a person could be at any point along each one independently.

  3
Independent factors
 With that in mind, some commonalities.
In situations of linguistic stability (variation without change), women use higher rates of prestigious/standard forms and lower rates of stigmatized forms than men do, overall (Labov 2001:266).
In other words, in the absence of change (e.g. with variable ING), women are overall more standard than men.

  3
Independent factors
 During linguistic change, women tend to be ahead of men by about one generation.
Women lead about 90% of linguistic changes that have been studied (though note bias: mostly Western world) (Tagliamonte 2012:63).
This is true regardless of whether the change is towards something more standard (called change from above) or towards something new and not yet standard (called change from below).
Hang on. Does that make any sense?

  3
Independent factors
  This is what is known as the
Gender Paradox.
 Women are more standard amidst stability.
Women are more standard in change from above.
Women are more standard.
And women lead linguistic change either way.
Women are less standard in change from below.
 
  3
Independent factors
 The key seems to be that if there is an overtly prestigious/ standard form, women stick to it. And if there is overt stigma, women avoid it.
Change from below does not introduce prestigious/ standard forms, but it does usually bring in forms that are so unconscious that they don’t have overt stigma.
Why do women seem to be more sensitive to prestige overall?
There are a few ideas.

  3
Independent factors
 Eckert 2000: “women have to do much more than men simply to maintain their place in the standard language market.”
In other words, under this interpretation, women are more standard because non-standard language counts against them more than it does for men.

  3
Independent factors
 That is, an overtly non-standard variant might be used by people of all genders...
...but it’s mostly the women who get told it makes them sound unprofessional, unconfident, indecisive, airheaded, etc.
It’s social judgment piled disproportionately on women.

  3
Independent factors
 Gender roles (what is considered ‘acceptable’ or ‘good’ for a particular gender class) are society-specific. They vary widely over time and place and culture.
Do communities with very different social expectations of men and women and other genders show other patterns?
More research pending!

Immigration/ethnolects
 Now we’re turning to the recent history of Canada: waves of immigration from beyond the British Isles (Chambers 2010).
1890s-1910 1946-1960
Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe
“Italians, Portuguese, Dutch, Belgians, Greeks, Ukrainians, Poles, Finns, and Yugoslavians, among others, and later, even more diversely, from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Korea, China, Vietnam, and the United States, as a result of political unrest in those countries.”

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 1970-2002:
“Pakistan, Chile, Brazil, Cambodia, Somalia, and El Salvador, but also from English- speaking countries in the Caribbean and from Hong Kong.”
Lots more immigration to Anglophone Canada (especially the cities) than Francophone Canada. Almost none to small-town Québec.

 
  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 The Boberg (2004) article covers research that we saw a little preview of in the ‘Talking Canadian’ video from the same year: ethnolects in Montréal English.
These are speakers who do speak English as a first language but with noticeable features that come from clustering based on ethnic/racial/cultural background.
 
  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 This is not based on any anatomical differences that might exist (Boberg 2004:540). Rather, it is about which speakers talk to which other speakers and how often.
“[E]thnolects often preserve unique features that distinguish them from the speech of the wider community, some of which can clearly be traced to the non-native varieties that preceded them” (2004:539).
In most places in Canada, ethnicity is not a particularly impactful independent variable (2004:540).
Old ethnolects, where they existed, have faded, and now “most European North Americans can no longer identify each other’s ethnic origins on the basis of speech” (2004:540).

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 Boberg gathered together people exclusively of Irish, Italian, and Jewish descent raised in Montréal, also accounting for age, sex, and level of education. Word-list data for this paper.
Hypothesis: those of Irish descent should speak a standard variety of Canadian English (baseline), and those of Italian descent (a more recent wave of immigration than most of the Jewish immigrants) should sound the most different.

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 /u/ is farther back for the Italian speakers – uncommonly so given the /u/-fronting that is a change in progress across dialects of North American English. Italian vowel- space is lower – uses more of the bottom of the mouth.
/ow/ is lower and farther forward among the Jewish population, and /ej/ is farther back.
Irish speakers front /æ/ before nasal consonants.

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 Taken together, “the ethnophonetic differences identified here cause the varieties of English spoken by Irish, Italian, and Jewish Montrealers to sound remarkably distinct from one another” (2004:558-559).
They live in distinct neighbourhoods and talk to each other in English, but there isn’t a lot of English-language mixing.

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 Significant effect of ethnic background in a giant statistical model.
No support for impression that /aj/ is more like [oj] in Jewish speakers.
But confirmation of hypothesis that Italian Montréal English would diverge from the baseline (Irish) more than Jewish Montréal English does.
Jews have been there longer, reaching back into times when there was more English in Montréal, and are well- educated (perhaps bringing them into more contact with standard Canadian English).

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 How about Toronto? Chinatown (and East Chinatown and Scarborough), Greektown, Tehranto, Little Italy, Little Portugal, Polish and Ukrainian neighbourhoods, etc.?
It’s a bit different. Lots more mixing. English is used by everyone, and the neighbourhoods blend into each other.
But attempts have been made, notably by James Walker (La Trobe University/York University) and Michol Hoffman (York University).

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 If you’re curious, look up Hoffman and Walker (2010) on Toronto ethnolects.
There are some effects, but it’s not as clear-cut as Montréal.
They consider the role of a newly defined independent factor: Ethnic Orientation (EO). This is measured through a long demographic survey: ‘How (Chinese) do you feel?’ or ‘Do you use (Italian) in your daily life?’ or ‘How often do you travel to (Poland) to see relatives?’
In Toronto, it might be less about influence from the immigrant languages and more about subtle differentiation for social reasons.

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 Outside the city, what happens when a distinctive population moves to a new place and brings a language/dialect with them?
Canada offers lots of interesting cases! And the best part is that a lot of them are severely understudied.
I have a student in my other class who came to office hours, reported being from a Ukrainian/English-speaking town on the Prairies, and asked, “Has anyone studied it?”
As far as I know, nope! I told the student to do so someday. ☺

 Let’s turn our attention to African-Americans in Nova Scotia: Poplack and Tagliamonte 2001, Chapter 3.

  2
Immigration/ethnolects Shana Poplack (1949-)
University of Ottawa
A legend. An early Ph.D. student of Labov’s at Columbia University.
Known for groundbreaking variationist approaches to language contact, especially American Spanish and Canadian French.
Has a very keen sense of methodological exactitude.
  
  2
Immigration/ethnolects Sali A. Tagliamonte (1960-)
University of Toronto
Our department chair!
Known for many in-depth studies of variation and change, especially morphosyntactic.
Dialectology of Toronto and rural Ontario.
Has written 5 books, including a history of variationist sociolinguistics (2015).
  
  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 Shana and Sali have both worked extensively on African- American English outside the U.S., and co-wrote a book about the African-American diaspora in 2001.
Canada, especially Ontario and the Maritimes, became home to a lot of African-Americans fleeing slavery, but conditions were not always welcoming here. Black folks were often given the short end of the stick. What little they got, white people often protested, citing strong beliefs about who was and wasn’t entitled to things.
As late as the 1960s, the town of Africville was destroyed by the government and its residents forcibly relocated. The Africville Apology finally took place in 2010.

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 Today marks the release of the new ten-dollar bill, featuring Viola Desmond of Nova Scotia, who refused to stand for segregation in a movie theatre in the 1940s, along with the Museum of Human Rights in Winnipeg.
 
  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 A lot of communities founded by African-Americans were small, isolated, and self-contained; “there remain some communities in Nova Scotia which are almost entirely populated by the descendants” (Poplack and Tagliamonte 2001:40).
Guysborough and North Preston are excellent examples. The community turned out to be bidialectical (Poplack and Tagliamonte 2001:55): they code-switch between Standard Canadian English and African-American Vernacular English.

  2
Immigration/ethnolects This is one of several possible outcomes of language
contact in small places.
Here’s another one, based on present research of mine!
 
  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 (For more on the historical background, see Wild 1995.)
Just after 1900, a group of well-educated, idealistic Finns decided to move to the New World and establish a utopia. As you do.
They packed up, moved to British Columbia, leased an island from the B.C. government, and built a town: Sointula, Finnish for ‘harmony’.

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 Following several devastating fires, the original aims of the colony fizzled out. But many of the founders and descendants stayed.
They believed in some then-radical ideas, such as gender equity, getting plenty of exercise, intense communal arts events, and giving birth in a sauna (hot enough to ensure at least some sterility).

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 No one spoke English until the 1940s, when the government of B.C. hired schoolteachers and sent them in. Children were discouraged from speaking Finnish and sometimes punished if they were caught doing so.

  2
Immigration/ethnolects
 Through the 1970s, the community opened up a bit, attracting various artists, nature-lovers, Americans fleeing the draft, and other nonconformists.
The current population is 750 or 800.
Everyone there now speaks English, but there are still a few dozen native speakers of Finnish and the roots of the community are strong.
Maybe the English of Sointula bears traces of Finnish, even in speakers who do not speak Finnish at all.
That’s my hypothesis!

SOCIOLINGUISTICS CONCEPT OF THE WEEK:
Regionality/isoglosses
Regionality/isoglosses
 
  3
Regionality/isoglosses Dialectology and sociolinguistics are closely related.
Dialectology has a long history across a lot of languages and countries.
Sociolinguistics is more modern and often more quantitative.
It takes into account independent factors, as we’ve seen (social and linguistic alike).
But there’s a lot of overlap.
 
  3
Regionality/isoglosses Some variables depend heavily on region.
Saussure (1916:193): “geographical separation is still the most general force in linguistic diversity.”
(Not so true anymore – social divisions play a larger role now. But geography still enters into it in some cases.)
 
  3
Regionality/isoglosses
 
  3
Regionality/isoglosses
 For this variable (or for any variable), if we found a geographic pattern, we could draw a line dividing areas with different predominant/majority variants.
Such lines are called
 isoglosses.

Regionality/isoglosses
 If we studied words for default 2nd-plural pronouns across the continental U.S...
and if we got this result...
 this thing would be our isogloss.

Regionality/isoglosses Isoglosses are the most accurate when many people from
lots of different locations are studied...
...and when it isn’t just averaged by state/province.

Regionality/isoglosses
 (hypothetical, but adapted from reality...)
  
  3
Regionality/isoglosses
 What makes an area sufficiently distinctive to be its own dialect is not clear-cut.
We could study every variable we could think of and quantify the differences, but we’d still have to pick an arbitrary cut-off for ‘different enough’.
So dialect areas and labels have some degree of arbitrariness.

  3
Regionality/isoglosses But the idea we keep returning to is that isolation leads to
dialect divergence (Sapir 1921).
Change is happening all the time in every natural language; if two groups are split up, their linguistic change will go in two different directions.
Their senses of identity and in-group and out-group factors may also diverge if interaction is limited.
 
  3
Regionality/isoglosses
 An excellent case study of all this from the U.S.: the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (the non-mitten-shaped piece).

Regionality/isoglosses
 The Upper Peninsula of Michigan is much less populated and geographically more remote than the rest of the state.
I lived in Michigan for a year and never went anywhere near there.

 People tend to sound like the place they grew up in (combined with age, gender, class, etc.).
Ages 7 to 14 seem to play the biggest role in shaping someone’s phonological system (Chambers 1992).

Regionality/isoglosses
 But there’s another factor involved when it comes to place: how attached you are to the place you come from.
This is sometimes called   or allegiance.
This factor formed part of the first study in variationist sociolinguistics.

The future of Canadian English
 With Canadian English, we have seen a lot of changes in the past few decades:
• Canadian Dainty has vanished (Chambers 2010).
• While this is very much still a settler-colonial state, Britishness no longer has the prestige it once did among Canadians of European descent.
• Old ethnolects are, at least in some places, disappearing (Boberg 2004).
• Ontario and B.C. English have shown convergence.

  2
The future of Canadian English
 On the level of individual variables, we can make predictions based on changes in progress that are occurring.
GOOSE is fronting. The Canadian Shift is happening. Yods are disappearing (except maybe in Victoria). The use of eh? has plummeted, at least in the cities.

  2
The future of Canadian English
 Morphosyntactic and discourse-pragmatic variables in Toronto English (Tagliamonte 2006):
• Future be going to is coming in against will. • Possessive have is coming in against have got.
• Have to is the incoming form for deontic modality (expressing obligation).
• Quotative be like is catching on.
• Intensifying adverb very is dropping out, and really and maybe so are replacing it.

  2
The future of Canadian English
 Some of those changes are happening absolutely everywhere in the English-speaking world.

The future of Canadian English
 As transportation and communication technology improve, some rural areas have become better connected with the cities.
Last week I talked about my fieldwork trip to Sointula, and how the town has opened up to the surroundings and shifted to Canadian English.
Victoria is catching up to most changes occurring in Canadian English (Roeder et al. 2018).

The future of Canadian English
 Is this happening everywhere? Not necessarily!
People are certainly better connected, but as we’ve seen, so much about language (and all social practice) is about group membership and how people define themselves. ‘I am like these people’ or ‘I am not like these people’ – consciously and not – have enormous effects on language.
Linguistic features index different characteristics – this can be subtle and extremely localised.
“And there is still, thank goodness, so much more to learn” (Chambers 2011).

The future of Canadian English
 Van Herk (2011):
“I’ve been interviewed about my research quite often since arriving here five years ago, and no matter what I say, the headlines come out the same: ‘Is the Newfoundland accent disappearing?’ [...] ‘Are Newfoundlanders losing their distinct dialect?’“
His own answer is ‘absolutely not!’.

  2
The future of Canadian English
 Van Herk (2011):
“In rural areas, traditional features like verbal s-marking (I goes, you knows) and interdental stopping (dat
ting for that thing) are still extremely healthy. In urban areas, they seem to be making a comeback among youth after a generation of decline.”
Every language and dialect is made up of innumerable variables. Some of the non-standard elements might be declining, at least in some places, but that doesn’t mean Newfoundland English is suddenly no more.

  2
The future of Canadian English
 Van Herk (2011):
“...young Newfoundlanders aren’t rejecting traditional speech, nor are they unthinkingly maintaining it. They’re overtly messing with it to create a new sense of identity.”
In other words, if a variant is overtly recognised as a Newfoundland English thing, younger speakers can – and do! – actively employ it to signal ‘I’m from Newfoundland’.

  2
The future of Canadian English
 So there’s no guarantee that more contact across dialects of Canadian English would simply level everything.
On top of that, Canada has become a whole lot less British-centric as people have moved here from all over the world in recent decades.
Canada is home to lots of different types of people. The proportion who have nothing but British ancestry has declined substantially (Boberg 2010:95-96).
And there are more and more people like your professor – a mix of old British settlers and more-recent refugees from elsewhere (Boberg 2010:97).
There is no one kind of Canadian.

  2
The future of Canadian English
 So-called ‘assimilation’ happens when immigrants’ kids and those whose families have been here longer grow up together with shared language, social practices, trends, inside jokes, etc.
It doesn’t mean their own culture/religion/heritage language automatically disappears, however.
Or ethnolects – which, “it is predicted, will alter the nature of Canadian English” Hoffman and Walker (2010:42).

Part One: Overview and General Characteristics of Canadian English
1
  English in Canada1
J. K. Chambers
1. Background, including demographic and geographical information
1.1. Geographical information. Canada is the second largest nation in the world, after Russia, occupying almost ten million square kilometres. It encompasses six time zones, spanning four-and-a-half hours from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast. Climate, topography, local networks, geographical orientation, and other factors vary regionally so that the physical experiences of Canadians in the far north, for instance, bear little resemblance to those in the southernmost regions.
Culturally, Canada is complicated by the existence within the Canadian boundaries of two long-standing national consciousnesses which simultaneously share Canadian nationality and maintain their own. Québec is the power base for the francophone minority, equal partners in Confederation since its inception in 1867. Newfoundland joined Confederation only in 1949 after centuries of colonial ties to Britain and self- government.

Linguistically, their presence affects Canadian English (hereafter CE) in interesting and very different ways (Chambers 1991). Québec‟s location interrupts the continuity of the English-language majority, splitting the Atlantic provinces from the central and western provinces, and perpetuates bilingual buffer zones in the adjacent provinces of New Brunswick on the east and Ontario on the west. (See Map in Appendix.) Newfoundland, though overwhelmingly anglophone, did not share mainland Canadian settlement history, and her political autonomy gave rise to an indigenous standard accent which is only now beginning to reflect the influence of mainland CE (Clarke 1991). Any generalizations that might be hazarded about CE must necessarily be qualified—implicitly or explicitly—by their presence.
Demographically, the population of 29,639,035 (in the 2001 Census) is often called sparse, but it is hardly that in world terms. Canada‟s population is twice Australia‟s, and three and a half times greater than Sweden‟s. It is almost the same as South Africa‟s and only slightly less than Spain‟s. The sparseness of Canada‟s population is noticeable mainly when one considers the thousands of square kilometres available for settlement. By comparison, the United Kingdom, which would fit handily into even the smallest of Canada‟s seven inland provinces, has about twice the population, and the United States, more comparable in size as the fourth largest nation in the world, has eight times the population.
One of the sources of Canadian national unity is the fact that the population is geographically concentrated along the southern border. Most Canadians live within two hundred kilometres of the U.S.-Canadian border. The Map of Canada (see Appendix) shows major urban areas, which house nearly two-thirds of the Canadian population; the remaining third live mainly in smaller cities and towns in the catchment area of the largest cities. The border is enormous, stretching more than 4,000 kilometres, but the population concentration in that long, thin ribbon belies the popular stereotype of Canada as a country of isolated homesteads.
Canadians are not only highly urbanized but also overwhelmingly middle-class, to an extent that can scarcely be comprehended by outsiders. As in the New-World societies of the United States and Australia, two factors conspired to determine the relatively homogeneous class structure (Chambers 1998c). On the one hand, Canada‟s earliest settlements offered virtually no amenities to settlers with aristocratic predilections, with the result that they were naturally excluded from most societies. On the other, the earliest political initiatives fostered geographical mobility as a means of uniting the enormous expanses that needed to be governed. The combination of social egalitarianism and freedom of movement led to occupational and social mobility on a scale unknown in the colonizing nations.
Social trends in the first half of the twentieth century further increased the class homogenization. Urbanization shrank the agricultural class to less than ten per cent of the population, and occupational mobility keeps the unskilled labour group at less than

five per cent (Camu, Weeks and Sametz 1971). More than 85 per cent of the population is thus middle-class, sharing to a greater or lesser degree their values, aspirations, living standards, and (outside of Québec and Newfoundland) speech standards.2
1.2. Brief history. Canadian English is one of the oldest varieties of colonial English. Because Canada is due west of England, it was one of the first discoveries in the European quest for a sea route to the Orient. The English first laid claim to Newfoundland, Canada‟s easternmost province and thus the nearest land mass on the Atlantic Ocean to Europe, in 1497, just five years after Columbus made his historic landing to the south. Newfoundland‟s discoverer was a Venetian, John Cabot, but he sailed from Bristol in England under the authority of the English king, Henry VII (Chadwick 1967).
The English claim to the rest of Canada was not as direct. In the Atlantic region of the present Maritime Provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island on Map 1 in Appendix), the French arrived before the English and established colonies in what they called Acadia. Samuel de Champlain, the first French governor, founded a settlement called Port Royal at the inlet to the St. Lawrence River in 1605. Three years later, in 1608, he established Nouvelle France inland on the St. Lawrence River in the vicinity of present-day Québec City and Montréal.
However, France seemed uninterested in its imperialist role in North America. By the middle of the 18th century, the population of the entire St. Lawrence colony numbered only about 70,000 (Chambers and Heisler 1999). The colonists were the descendants of some 10,000 individuals sent out to the New World from the mother country in a period of 150 years. Even though the birthrate in Nouvelle France was among the highest in the world, this trickle of settlers was hardly enough to establish critical mass (Joy 1972: 51-54; on birthrate and immigration, see §1.3.4 below). By contrast, England, with only one-third the population of France, sent many more settlers to its North American colonies, usually with incentives of free sea passage and freehold farmland to encourage them. This disparity had important consequences not only for Canadian history but for world history. They were described eloquently by the demographer Alfred Sauvy (translated by Lachapelle and Henripin 1982: 10):
It sufficed that one of the two countries competing for a vast continent sent a few thousand settlers each year, while the other sent a few hundred, and the course of
2 Between 1976 and 2007, the adjusted income of the middle 60% of the Canadian population remained steady while the gap between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% widened (Statistics Canada, 2009). Despite increasing income polarization, most Canadians still consider themselves “middle class.”—Eds.

history was radically changed. This is both tragic and symbolic, since, just when the French language had reached international predominance in Europe, through its great demographic superiority, it was sealing its fate in the world at large because a few boats more, filled with illiterates, left England every year.3
Partly as a result of this disparity, France was forced to cede both colonies to England after suffering defeats in two wars.
 In 1716, the Treaty of Utrecht resolved Queen Anne‟s War, and one of its terms made Acadia a British possession. The English divided the colony into the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and St. John (since 1798, Prince Edward Island).
 In 1763, England‟s victory on the Plains of Abraham in Québec City ended the French and Indian War, and by the terms of the Treaty of Paris, France was forced to surrender its hold on the inland colony.
So the English language came to be spoken in Canada because of the English aptitude for warfare. In the Middle Ages, the English people themselves had narrowly escaped becoming colonials dominated by the Normans, and in extricating themselves they inadvertently developed the political and military strengths that would eventually lead to the global spread of their language. Protracted wars against Normandy in particular and France in general, especially the Hundred Years War (1337-1453), developed military prowess and a readiness for aggression. Defending the surrounding seas required the English to develop navigational skills and sea-faring prowess. As a result, when the era of New World exploration dawned in 1492, the English were well equipped to compete with their rivals from France, Spain, Portugal, and Holland.
In inland Canada as in most parts of the New World, British explorers discovered vast land masses sparsely populated by Native hunters or subsistence farmers. Exactly the same discoveries were made by the Spanish in Argentina, the Portuguese in Brazil, the French in Vietnam, and the Dutch in Indonesia. In all instances, the European imperialists subdued the Native peoples either by conquests or treaties. In North America, the Native peoples often became allies of their British overlords, joining them in battles against their European rivals, especially the French. For more than two centuries, European foreign policies were dominated by these imperialist struggles. Although the historical record shows the English as world-beaters, fending off the Dutch in South Africa, the Spanish in the southern United States, and the French in Canada, in
3 Most males and many females on the boats from England were not illiterate according to Lawrence Cremin, who documents widespread basic literacy in both 18th century England and Colonial America in American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607-1783 (New York, Harper & Row, 1970).—Eds.

all these countries conflicts still arise among groups divided along linguistic lines. The descendants are now united not by fealty to their imperial founders but by fealty to their distinctive regional cultures.
The British turned out to be relatively benevolent governors in Canada. They immediately issued proclamations safeguarding certain rights of the Native peoples, including the requirement that ancestral lands could be surrendered only upon execution of legal treaties (Chambers 1990).4 Their relations with their French-speaking subjects proved equally benevolent with one notable exception that took place in the first years of their government. In 1755, when England and France engaged one another in the French and Indian War, many Acadians chose to remain neutral. The British governors, fearing they might side with France and thus provide a hostile element behind their lines, evicted some 10,000 of them. Most Acadians went southward into the United States, and many of them made their way to the former French colony of Louisiana, at the mouth of the Mississippi River, where they adapted their Acadian culture to local conditions. They are known today as „Cajuns,‟ the southern U.S. pronunciation of the word Acadian.
That incident remains vivid in Canada‟s francophone history. It was a mistake that the British seemed determined to avoid in the newly-acquired Nouvelle France. They instituted the Quebec Act in 1774 in order to establish the legal boundaries of their French-speaking colony. In 1791, when hundreds of English-speaking immigrants arrived as refugees from the American Revolution (discussed in §2.3 below), the governors passed the Constitution Act dividing „Quebec‟ into two separate colonies called Lower Canada (present-day Québec) and Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). As a result, the boundaries of the French-language colony remained distinct even as the French-speaking population became a minority. In effect, these administrative divisions guaranteed that the cultural and linguistic heritage of the French colonials would be perpetuated in the new land.
In 1867, the four provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Québec and Ontario joined in the Canadian Confederation. The other Maritime province, Prince Edward Island, where the Confederation Act was drafted and signed, was admitted in 1873. Expansion into the vast western territory known as Prince Rupert‟s Land came later: Manitoba
4 The British governors did not want settlers to negotiate land deals directly, but “for the first time, the Aboriginal people would be expected to extinguish their rights to the land in order for large-scale colonial settlement to take place” (Early Canadiana Online, Canada in the Making, 1763 - 1791: The Royal Proclamation, 1763, and the Québec Act, 1774, retrieved from http://www1.canadiana.org/citm/themes/aboriginals/aboriginals3_e.html).—Eds.

(1870), Saskatchewan (1905), Alberta (1905) and British Columbia (1871) followed the development of the transcontinental rail link. In 1949, Newfoundland joined as the tenth province. The vast subarctic regions, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, were incorporated as territories, not provinces, the former in 1870 and the latter in 1898. In 1999, a new territory, Nunavut, was created by partitioning the Northwest Territories to establish an Inuit-majority region.
1.3. Demographic information. Canada‟s population statistics as they relate to language use—Canada‟s „demolinguistics,‟ to use Lachapelle and Henripin‟s (1982) uncomely but functional word—are somewhat complicated by the fact that Canada has two official languages, English and French. But they become much more complicated by the fact that Canada has an astounding number of „non-official‟ languages as well. The Native peoples of Canada spoke at least a hundred different languages at the time of European discovery, and a few dozen survive to this day, though many are threatened with extinction. More significant demographically, throughout the twentieth century Canada provided a land of opportunity for immigrants and a haven for refugees. The newcomers have brought with them the languages of the world. I discuss the two great immigrations of the last century in §2.2 below.
As a result of these immigrations, Canada is perhaps the most multilingual nation in the world not only in the obvious sense that countless languages are spoken there but also in the sense that those language groups tend to sustain themselves beyond the second generation.
1.3.1. Canadian mother tongues. Statistics Canada, the government office responsible for the census, incorporated a useful distinction starting in 1991 in response to Canada‟s flourishing multilingualism. They asked respondents to distinguish between their „mother tongue,‟ defined as the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the individual, and their „home language,‟ defined as the language used daily in family situations. In this section I will describe the Canadian population in terms of their mother tongues (from Statistics Canada 2001; for analysis of both mother tongue and home language statistics, see Chambers 1998c: 264-68).
Table 1 below provides a finely detailed snapshot of Canada‟s linguistic diversity at the beginning of the millennium. It lists the Canadian demolinguistics in terms of the major language groups, starting with the official languages, including true bilinguals, that is, people who have more than one mother tongue, and then continues with specific listings for 15 non-official languages. In addition to the figures for the country as a whole, Table 1 lists the figures for the two largest provinces, Ontario and Québec, in order to underscore some points I want to make about the distribution of the official languages. Readers who might feel overwhelmed by the amount of detail can look at the summary lines indicated by the Totals following each sub-category.

1.3.2. The Aboriginal languages. The non-official languages listed in Table 1 include only those with more than 100,000 speakers with two exceptions. Cree and Inuktitut are aboriginal languages of the most populous Algonquian nation and of the Inuit peoples (formerly called, respectively, Indians and Eskimos). These are non-official languages, of course, but unlike the other non-official languages on the list, they are native (non-immigrant) languages. The Inuit are exhaustively represented by these numbers, but there are 20 other Native (Indian) languages besides Cree listed in the census tables, accounting for a few thousand speakers in the „Others‟ category. The reason for the large difference in the Inuit populations in Québec and Ontario is geographical: Québec occupies much more territory above the boreal tree line, where Inuit settlements are located. Greatest Inuit concentration (18,605 of the 26,670 total) is in Nunavut, which was created in 1999 to provide territorial autonomy for them. Inuit thus comprise about 70 per cent of the population. Almost all the rest, 26 per cent, have English as their mother tongue, making Nunavut the least linguistically diverse administrative region in the country.
1.3.3. The immigrant languages. Among the non-official languages, Chinese is the largest mother-tongue group. Although some Chinese in Canada arrived in the 1870s to work as „coolies‟ on the construction of the trans-Canada railroad, the Canadian Pacific, most arrived much more recently, since the 1960s, in the diaspora from south mainland China and Hong Kong. The great majority of Chinese-Canadians have been speakers of the Cantonese „dialect.‟ Because many Chinese arrived in a relatively recent influx, few of them have completely assimilated and become monolingual English speakers, and as a result the proportion of Chinese-Canadians whose mother tongue is Chinese rather than English is large.
The 1996 census was the first in which Chinese topped the list of non-official languages. As recently as 1991, and for five decades before that, the largest non-official language group was Italian. (Toronto is said to be the second-largest Italian city in the world after Rome.) Many third- and fourth-generation Italo-Canadians speak „kitchen Italian‟ with their grandparents and parents but their mother tongue is English. For the first time in 60 years, the Italo-Canadian community shows signs of linguistic assimilation to the English majority. In the 1990s, though their rank order fell to second among immigrant groups after the Chinese, it was not the result of attrition of people whose mother tongue is Italian: in 1991 they numbered 449,660, and in 1996 they numbered 484,500, an increase of almost 35,000. However, in 2001, as Table 1 shows, they numbered 469,485, a decrease of about 15,000 —not many (in fact, only 3 percent) but significant as a counter-trend to the pattern of the last half-century. The change in rank order is the direct result of growth in the Chinese-Canadian community: in 1991 the Chinese mother-tongue respondents numbered 444,940; that number grew by 270,700 in the next five years, and, as Table 1 shows, by another 138,100 in 2001, over 400,000 in a decade.

1.3.4. Immigration and insularity. One point of contrast in Table 1 which has significant sociolinguistic implications is the contrast between Québec and Ontario with respect to non-official languages. In Ontario, 23.6 per cent of the population (2,672,095 of 11,285,560) have a mother tongue other than French or English, whereas in Québec only 9.9 per cent (709,415 of 7,125,570) do. This difference reflects a sharp distinction between the two provinces. Ontario, and indeed all of anglophone Canada, chose immigration as the principal means of expanding its population base, as will become evident in the next section where I discuss the peopling of the nation that has taken place over slightly more than two centuries. Like other New World countries, Canada adopted immigration naturally, as a critically underpopulated nation with an abundance of uncultivated land, unmined natural resources, and, latterly, developing industry. In Québec, only the city of Montréal receives immigrants at a rate comparable to the major anglophone cities. Elsewhere in the province of Québec, immigration is negligible.
This contrast has distinguished the francophone and anglophone regions from the beginning of Canadian history. After the French and Indian War, Québec‟s population growth from about 10,000 citizens in 1760 to over seven million today included about 20,000 anglophones at the end of the 18th century, mostly refugees from the American Revolution as described in the next section, but otherwise the growth has been almost entirely due to Québec‟s birthrate (Lachapelle and Henripin, 1982: 97-117). Throughout the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, Québec‟s birthrate was around 65 per 1,000, one of the highest in the world. It is now around 13 per 1,000, one of the lowest in Canada. With a declining birthrate and relatively little immigration, Québec‟s population is decreasing proportionately in Canada. . . .
Though Québec nationalism appears to be based on linguistic differences, its basis goes much deeper (Chambers 2004: 107-11). The sociocultural contrasts between societies with significant and continuous immigration and those with stable populations, that is, without significant influxes from outside, are sharp. Belief systems in immigrant societies like anglophone Canada tend to be diffuse because of the importation of diverse creeds, rites, and customs. Ethnicities are more diverse and racial mixing more common. Language is more varied and unstable across generations, with second- language varieties as well as native varieties, different mother tongues in the same household, and loanwords, code-switching and interlanguage. Patriotism is likely to be more diffuse (less focused) and less fervent.
One of the more extreme branches of Québec culture is called pure laine nationalism, where pure laine (literally „pure wool‟, a term used on garment labels) stands for ethnic purity in the sense of direct descent from the original Nouvelle France settlers. In the rest of Canada and in much of Québec, this kind of nationalism is viewed as narrow- minded at best and racist at worst. It is a strain of political thought at odds with Canadian openness and tolerance. . . .

1.3.5. The official languages. All regions of Canada are institutionally bilingual. Every citizen has the right to be served in either French or English by government agencies, tried in either language in federal courts, informed in either language in public announcements on radio and television, and advised in both languages on product labels, tax forms and all other official documents. Only two provinces have linguistic provisions in their constitutions: New Brunswick is constitutionally bilingual, and Québec is officially monolingual French (Joy 1992: 79-80). Québec provincial laws forbid employers to require any language but French of prospective employees (Joy 1992: 9) and forbid merchants from displaying English-language signs.5 Ironically, federal provisions on bilingualism ensure a nationwide presence for French from the Atlantic to the Pacific, even in regions where the francophone population is nonexistent, but the nationwide presence of English is interrupted officially, though not actually, by Québec monolingualism.
Table 1 above shows that there is a considerable discrepancy in sheer numbers between the French-speaking and the English-speaking populations. In percentages, the mother-tongue groups are proportioned as follows: 59.2 per cent speak English, 22.7 per cent speak French, 0.4 per cent are English-French bilinguals, and 17.5 per cent have a mother tongue neither English nor French. It is important to point out, as a cautionary note, that these mother-tongue figures grossly underrepresent bilingualism in all guises. The French-English bilinguals in these figures count only „true bilinguals,‟ rare individuals who learned both languages from birth (Weinreich 1967: Chap. 3). There are, of course, millions of other bilinguals in Canada whose competence in the two languages is asymmetrical or unequal. In fact, French-English bilingualism has been increasing by leaps in the Ontario region bordering Québec under the stimulus of educational immersion and equity policies (Cartwright 1988).
Bilingualism aside, the French mother-tongue population is heavily concentrated in the province of Québec. The concentration shows up dramatically when Québec‟s numbers are left out of the demolinguistic calculations as in Table 2: outside of Québec, English is the mother tongue of 75.5 per cent (about 17.5 million of 22.5), French of 4.2 per cent (953,300), bilingual French-English (true bilinguals) make up 0.2 per cent (67,245), and non-official languages are mother tongues of 19.9 per cent (almost 4.5 million).

 English in Canada, J.K. Chambers

Table 2 below also provides quantitative evidence for the observation made above, that Québec accounts for a relatively small percentage of immigrant languages: the percentages of non-official mother-tongue speakers are very similar across Canada whether or not Québec is counted. However, other proportions on the table change dramatically.
When we compare the percentages for English and French mother-tongue speakers in Table 2, the concentration of French speakers in Québec stands out clearly. Not only is French the mother tongue of fewer than 4.5 per cent of the population outside Québec, but a glance back at Table 1 will reveal that more than half of those French speakers outside Québec live in adjoining Ontario. The proportion of French speakers in Canada has been increasing in Québec and decreasing in the rest of Canada at least since 1931, the first year the census recorded mother-tongue statistics (Lachapelle and Henripin 1982: 39). The relative isolation of francophones within the provincial boundaries is one obvious source of Québecois anxiety about the survival of its language and culture. The effect is a spiral. Legislation of protective measures such as French-only language laws in Québec leads to disaffection among the English-language minority and emigration to other provinces, which further isolates the French speakers in the province.6

Because Table 2 tabulates mother-tongue statistics rather than functional language use, it inadvertently obscures the extent to which Canada is an English-speaking country. The figure for the English-speaking population outside Québec is large at 75.5 per cent, but in addition it must be kept in mind that Canadians whose mother tongue is a non- official language, almost 20 per cent of the population, are almost unanimously speakers of English, not French, as a second language. That brings the actual proportion of anglophones outside Québec to 95 per cent. The next section outlines the various routes by which these English-speaking peoples came to the country.
2. Linguistic background and contacts
2.1. The distinctiveness of Newfoundland. Newfoundland, the tenth province, did not participate in the events that shaped mainland Canada until 1949, when it joined the Confederation. It had a very different settlement pattern and colonial history (Shorrocks 1997), and consequently it is the most linguistically distinctive region of English-speaking Canada.
Newfoundland was first discovered by Norse adventurers around 1000, but they appear to have settled there only temporarily, perhaps seasonally. At the time of Newfoundland‟s re-discovery by Europeans 500 years later, the Norse contact had left so few traces that it took archaeologists until the 1960s to unearth them (Ingstad 1969). Newfoundland‟s waters teemed with codfish, and fishermen from Portugal as well as England rushed to harvest them. Permanent settlers arrived soon after, mostly from southwestern England, especially from the seafaring regions of Devon, Dorset, Somerset and Hampshire. Then, in the 18th century, Irish immigrants began arriving in such great numbers as to dominate many areas, including the capital, St. John‟s.
Because of its years of autonomy, there are many features that distinguish Newfoundland speech from mainland Canada in sound and in vocabulary (Paddock 1977, Story 1977, Clarke 1997). Sociolinguistic studies show, however, that the successive post-confederation generations are adopting some mainland features, especially the urban middle class (Clarke 1991). As geographical and occupational mobility further increases, the differentness of Newfoundland English will undoubtedly diminish.
2.2. The peopling of Canada. While Newfoundland was being settled by West Country fisherfolk and Irish workers, the rest of Canada was being wrested from the French on the Atlantic seaboard and then receiving settlers progressively westward. It took two centuries for the settlers to cover the vast expanse, and they arrived in four significant waves of immigration. Each wave had linguistic implications—that is, the immigrants influenced the way in which English is spoken in Canada to some extent. But, predictably, the first two influxes were much more important linguistically than the subsequent ones because they took place when the character of CE was not yet formed, and thus they had a formative influence.
English in Canada, J.K. Chambers

The four major waves of immigration were these:
 Beginning in 1776 and reaching its peak in 1793, hundreds of refugees from the Thirteen Colonies (soon to become the United States of America) entered Canada; these were the people known in Canadian history as Loyalists, the citizens of the southern colonies who chose to maintain their allegiance to the imperial mother-country, England, and fled rather than participating in the American Revolution.
 Beginning around 1815 and reaching its peak around 1850, thousands of immigrants from England, Scotland, and latterly Ireland (because of the Potato Famine of 1845-7) arrived in Canada as a result of systematic, large-scale recruitment by the British governors of the colony in order to counteract pro- American sentiments among the settlers, especially in the face of American border invasions in the War of 1812.
 Beginning in the 1890s and reaching a peak around 1910, thousands of immigrants again from Scotland and Ireland but also many from more diverse European homelands such as Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, and Ukraine were recruited as farmers for the vast wheatlands of the newly-opened Prairie Provinces and as workers for the industrializing cities in Ontario and Montreal in Quebec.
 Beginning in 1946 and reaching a peak around 1960, a highly diverse immigrant population arrived first as a result of the post-War diaspora in Europe, with thousands of Italians, Portuguese, Dutch, Belgians, Greeks, Ukrainians, Poles, Finns, and Yugoslavians, among others, and later, even more diversely, from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Korea, China, Vietnam, and the United States, as a result of political unrest in those countries.
In the last 25 years Canada has received another significant wave of immigrants, often as political refugees from such countries as Pakistan, Chile, Brazil, Cambodia, Somalia, and El Salvador, but also from English-speaking countries in the Caribbean and from Hong Kong. The linguistic diversity evident in Table 1 above is largely the result of this wave combined with the previous one.
By the time of the immigrations that peaked in 1910 and 1960, the linguistic character of Canada was firmly established. The immigrants could thus have only a mild, and minor, immediate influence. Their long-term influence, however, may be more significant. The preponderance of ESL accents in Canada‟s major cities is truly remarkable. In Toronto, for instance, four of every 10 people (40 per cent) speak an immigrant language natively, and so do 27 per cent in Vancouver, 21 per cent in
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader
13

Winnipeg, and 17 per cent in Montréal. As a result, in the most densely populated parts of Canada, people encounter ESL accents daily, and they have done so for two generations or more. If some features of those ESL varieties persist in the native varieties of the immigrants‟ offspring, they will enter CE as markers of urban or ethnic accents. Though no one has yet documented such persistent features, they clearly exist. Because of them, listeners can often identify speakers as having, say, Yiddish ancestry or an Italian background, even in the speech of native Canadians far removed from their immigrant roots. From a sociolinguistic perspective, it seems inevitable that some of the diversity currently heard as interlanguage will ultimately be recognized as markers of urban CE accents (Chambers 1998c: 264-71, 2004: 105-07).7
2.3. The Loyalist base. The first immigrants to arrive in Canada were the refugees from the American Revolution, the Loyalists, in the last decades of the 18th century.
There were two main paths of immigration for the Loyalists. One was from the coastal New England States—especially Connecticut and Massachusetts, where the first skirmishes of the Revolution took place in 1776, but also Maine and Rhode Island—into the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Many of these refugees, perhaps most, bided their time in Halifax or Lunenburg, the main seaports of the province, until they could arrange passage to England. Some others stayed in Nova Scotia or in nearby New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, finding work on the land or in towns. Still others took advantage of government offers of generous land grants further inland, along the banks of the St. Lawrence River and the north shore of Lake Ontario, and made the trek into the regions of Lower and Upper Canada.
These refugees from New England brought with them a distinctive home dialect. New England speech was then, as it is now, r-less and also had several readily identifiable vowel sounds. Wherever the New England refugees became the founding population of a community, the local speech came to sound like New England English. But this happened only in a very small, highly localized region. The town of Lunenburg (about 40km south of Halifax on Map 1) and some rural areas in Lunenburg County and the Annapolis Valley were marked linguistically as descendants of the New England dialect region (Trudgill 2000). In this century, with accelerated mobility and urbanization, the distinctive sound of that New England ancestry has receded in these regions.

In the inland regions, no trace of the New England accent persevered or survived. By the time the New England Loyalists reached their inland destinations, they were greeted by other Loyalists—refugees who had taken the second route into Canada. And though they too were native Americans, they brought with them a very different accent.
These other Loyalists set out principally from the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont, and they moved by inland routes to entry points at the narrows of the lower Great Lakes, mainly crossing the border at the upper St. Lawrence River from Montréal westward, along the Detroit River in the region of present-day Windsor, and especially at the Niagara frontier in Upper Canada. There, they were met by Canadian government officials and sent, with a modest allotment of provisions and tools, to homesteads in the richly forested parklands of the Great Lakes basin. In every district where they landed, they formed the first settled population. Native peoples—the Iroquois (Hurons, Tobacco, Oneidas, and others) and Algonquians (mainly Delawares, Odawas, Ojibwas)—circulated through the regions harvesting roots or grains and hunting game, and white or mixed-blood trappers (coureurs de bois) cut across the regions chasing pelts and hides. But the Loyalists were the first people to fence in parcels of land, clear them of roots and rocks, and raise houses and outbuildings on them. Where their numbers were concentrated, some of them quit farming to provide goods and services for the others: mills for lumber and mills for flour, blacksmithing, slaughterhouses, tanning, spinning and weaving, rooms and meals for travelers, arithmetic and spelling lessons, Sunday sermons. Towns grew up as central places for distributing goods and services, with churches, schools, markets, and stores.
These people became the founding population of inland Canada. Socially, they brought with them the manners and mores of the middle American states where they originated, as distinct from the Yankees north of them in New England and the planters south of them in Virginia and Georgia. Linguistically, they brought with them the sounds and syntax of those same middle states on the Atlantic coast.
The founding population of any place exerts many subtle and largely unintentional dictates on those who succeed them. They set the pattern for roads in the country and streets in the town, establish local practices (land-clearing, crop selection, house construction, religious observance, educational practices, and much more), determine norms of communal cooperation (midwifery, health care, sewing bees, barn raising) and set the moral tone of the community.
One of the subtlest dictates—and one seldom considered because it is beneath consciousness—is linguistic. The people who come after the founding population, the second or third generation of settlers, may come from far and wide, but their children will speak, under ordinary circumstances, just like the children whose parents arrived before them. So it came to pass in inland Canada—Lower Canada and especially Upper
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader
15

Canada, destined to become the economic and political wheelhorse of the nation for the next century—that the sound of the speech was directly descended from these Loyalists.
As a result, it is a common experience of young Canadians today, whether their ancestry be Scottish, German, or Bangladeshi, to be mistaken for Americans when they go travelling across the globe. To foreigners, unless they have a good ear for subtle differences, Canadians sound American. That is the heritage of the Loyalist founders.
2.4. The British and Irish arrivals after 1812. The Americans began looking covetously northward soon after they gained their independence. In June 1812, the United States declared war on Britain and launched a series of raids on the Canadian borders. The event is known as the War of 1812 but it actually lasted until 1814, when the Treaty of Ghent ended the conflict with neither side gaining any advantage over the other. Militarily, the war was a draw, but from the Canadian viewpoint it seemed a victory. The aggressor had been repelled, after all, and the Canadian border remained intact.
The American invasions took place at the very sites where the Loyalists had entered the country. The British were embroiled at the same time in the Napoleonic Wars in Europe and could spare very few troops for defending their North American colony, but the outnumbered defenders eventually beat back the American insurgents. The Canadian victories aroused the first significant show of national pride, and today virtually all the battle sites are marked by monuments.
British intelligence later discovered that the Americans relied on finding widespread sympathy for their cause in Canada. They had expected their invading armies to be swelled by anti-English sympathizers as they marched through the colony. Instead, they met with stout resistance at every step. Though the Canadians proved their loyalty, the governors felt uneasy about the broad base of American ancestry in Canada, and they set about diluting that base by recruiting British settlers with promises of transport and generous gifts of land.
Between 1830 and 1860, thousands of British and Irish emigrants settled in Canada, especially along the north shores of the two Great Lakes, Ontario and Erie, but also inland in regions where the Loyalist presence was sparse. Their numbers more than doubled the population of Upper Canada, which to that time comprised the second- and third-generation Loyalists. Economically, the immigrants broadened the consumer base and brought new initiatives. Politically, they brought debating skills and imperialist powerlust. It is an astounding fact that three of Canada‟s first five Prime Ministers arrived in Canada as immigrant children or youth—the first, John A. Macdonald (in office 1867-73 and 1878-91) and the second, Alexander Mackenzie (1873-78) were native Scots, and the fifth, Mackenzie Bowell (1894-96) was born in England.

2.5. Linguistic influence of British and Irish immigrants. Linguistically, the long- term influence of the British immigrants was highly restricted. Most of the immigrants settled, naturally, in the towns and villages founded by the Loyalists, and, predictably, their Canadian-born children grew up speaking not like their parents but like the children who became their schoolmates and playmates. The essential Loyalist character of CE persisted.
In two accidental senses, the British accents and dialects of the 19th century immigrants made a direct and indisputable impression on Canadian speech. First, in relatively isolated regions where the immigrants became the founding population, their speech formed the basis of the local accent. To this day, one can discern the Scots roots of rural speech in Cape Breton, Pictou and Antigonish counties in Nova Scotia, the Ottawa Valley, Peterborough county, the West Lorne district on the north shore of Lake Erie, and other places. Since Newfoundland joined the Confederation, Canada has come to encompass a large and influential enclave where the speech descends from Irish ancestors.
The second impression was made at the opposite pole, so to speak. Though the English immigrants could not impose their speech sounds on their offspring, they often did succeed in imposing norms of propriety and correctness on them, and on the community in general. Many English immigrants frankly promulgated their linguistic superiority to the benighted natives. Thus Susanna Moodie, whose snide and snobbish account of her immigrant experience, Roughing It in the Bush (1852), greatly amused the Victorian gentlefolk she left behind in England, described the first Canadian dialect she ever heard, that of the immigration recruiter, by saying he “had a shocking delivery, a drawling vulgar voice; and he spoke with such a twang that I could not bear to look at him or listen to him. He made such grammatical blunders that my sides ached laughing at him.”
English immigrants took it upon themselves to try and change linguistic practices that differed from their own. In almost all cases, these practices differed because they were based on American rather than British models. The first schoolteachers in inland Canada were Loyalists or descendants of them, and they used the pedagogical tools they were familiar with. Noah Webster‟s spelling-book, for instance, was almost universally used in Upper Canada schools.8 It included spellings like color, neighbor, center, meter, and
8 Elaine Gold details a mixed American and British provenance for teachers and texts: see “Teachers, Texts, and Early Canadian English: Upper Canada 1791-1841” in Sophie Burelle and Stanca Somesfalean, eds., Proceedings of the 2003 Annual Conference of the Canadian Linguistic Association, 2004, 85-96.—Eds.
17
 Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader

connection instead of colour, neighbour, centre, metre, and connexion, and it included pronunciations like secretARY, reNAIssance, lootenant (for lieutenant), eether (for either), and zee, instead of SECret'ry, renaissANCE, leftenant, eyether, and zed.
One result of the belated intervention on language standards by the English immigrants is the Canadian double standard in many matters of spelling and pronunciation. Wherever British and American practices differ from one another, Canadians usually tolerate both. For instance, many Canadians freely vary their pronunciation of either and neither without noticing any discrepancy or raising any controversy, and different regions sometimes maintain different norms, as when, for instance, Ontarians prefer the spellings colour and neighbour but Albertans prefer color and neighbor (Ireland 1979: 178-79). These double standards are the linguistic legacy of the first two mass immigrations in Canadian history.
Another result, much less obvious but no less real, was attitudinal. In the second half of the 19th century, Canadians came to regard British standards as superior, whether or not they were the ones in common use. This attitude insinuated itself into the Canadian ethos politically as well as linguistically. At many points in Canadian history, being patriotically Canadian has defined itself as being anti-American, either mildly or vituperatively, and in decades past—though probably not since the 1940s—it often also entailed being pro-British.
Many genteel Canadians affected British speech and manners. Throughout the 20th century, many Canadian-born military officers, diplomats, professors, CBC newscasters, actors, and other members of the self-styled cultural élite made themselves „Anglo- Canadian.‟ The poet Irving Layton took that as the title of his satirical poem describing a professor of English at Queen‟s University (Scott and Smith 1967: 75):
Anglo-Canadian
A native of Kingston, Ont. —two grandparents Canadian and still living
His complexion florid
as a maple leaf in late autumn, for three years he attended Oxford
Now his accent
makes even Englishmen wince, and feel unspeakably colonial.
English in Canada, J.K. Chambers
18

Nowadays, the Anglo-Canadian élite have become relics, along with the Union Jack, the British Commonwealth, and „God Save the Queen.‟ Britain‟s failure to impose itself on recent generations of Canadians coincides, of course, with the decline of Britain as a world power, but, more to the point, the ethnically diverse immigrations of the 20th century have diluted the Anglo-Celtic hegemony. The image of Britain as Canada‟s mother country is a historical fact, but it is as far removed from Canada‟s daily affairs as is Victorianism.
2.6. Homogeneity of urban, middle-class Canadian English. As Canada settled its western region in the second half of the 19th century, the first settlers were mainly white Protestants from southern Ontario. Their prominence there was not accidental. In 1870, when the Canadian governors first attempted to carry out a land survey of the Red River Valley—the region around present-day Winnipeg, then (as now) the most populous part of Manitoba—they were opposed by the people who were already there.9 The strongest opposition came from the Métis, French-speaking Catholics of mixed Québecois and Algonquian ancestry who comprised about half the population of 12,000. They were quelled forcibly by Canadian troops, and their leader Louis Riel fled to the United States. Riel returned in 1885 to lead a second rebellion against Canadian expansion in Saskatchewan. This time, when the rebels were defeated by Canadian troops at Batoche, the Métis capital, Riel was captured. He was imprisoned in Regina, tried for treason, and hanged.
Following these rebellions, the governors ensured that the first significant wave of settlers in the prairies would be sympathetic to their plans for expansion by making generous land grants to the infantry volunteers who had quelled Riel and to other Ontarians. In so doing, they transplanted not only the central Canadian ethos but also, inevitably, the Ontario accent. As a result, CE is remarkably homogeneous across the vast expanse of the country. Except for Newfoundland, urban, middle-class anglophone Canadians speak with much the same accent in Vancouver and Ottawa, Edmonton and Windsor, Winnipeg and Fredericton. The greatest variety, as mentioned above, is found away from the cities, in those rural enclaves founded by settlers from different linguistic backgrounds. In the 20th century, another source of variety arose in working-class neighbourhoods populated mainly by immigrants who are speakers of English as a second language. Their children and grandchildren normally speak like other Canadians
9 The Métis had settled the Red River Valley with the long, narrow, seugneurial-style lots of New France, each with crucial river frontage. The surveyors sent from the newly established Dominion of Canada were to draw square lots and townships for new settlers over the existing settlement.—Eds.

 Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader

of their age and social class, but there is some evidence for socially significant linguistic variation from this source, as described in §2.2 above.
3. Phonology
Canadian English forms one branch of North American English, with historical affinities to the speech of Midland and Northern United States (Bloomfield 1948). The primary bough in the family tree for world Englishes splits the North American branch from the others, usually known as the British branch.
North America received its first permanent settlers more than a century before Britain‟s southern hemisphere colonies, with the result that the starting-point in the two regions was essentially different. The differences were maximized because in the 18th century, after the North American settlement, the English spoken in the motherland underwent several changes. For one thing, it became largely r-less, so that the r sound was no longer pronounced in words like bark ], bar [:], and barber [ˈ:]. For another thing, the vowel in words like laugh, bath, chant, and dance came to be pronounced long and usually farther back as [:]: thus [:], [:], [:], and [:].10 Most Canadian and American varieties lack these features, and most Australian, New Zealand and South African varieties have them. The presence of these and other similar features in the southern hemisphere varieties link them more closely to the accents of England.
Other general features that occur in North American English accents but not in the varieties spoken in England and the southern-hemisphere countries include the following:
 the vowel contrast in words like logger and lager is generally lost, so that North American varieties have the same vowel in both words, and also in bother and father, bomb and balm (Trudgill and Hannah 1982: 33). . . .
 voicing of /t/ intervocalically when the preceding syllable is stressed: thus city is [] [i.e., it rhymes with biddy], little is [] and hearty and hardy are both pronounced []. . . .
Within the North American branch, standard CE is distinguished from other varieties by two very distinctive phonological features. One is the merger of low back vowels, so that CE has only one low back vowel phoneme where most other standard varieties of English have two. Phonologically, this is the most structurally significant feature of CE. It has
10 See “The Sounds of the Language,” by R.E. McConnell, this volume, for a gentle introduction to how Canadian English sounds different from British and American.—Eds.
English in Canada, J.K. Chambers
20
 
been a feature of standard CE from the earliest records, remarked upon as early as 1850 (Chambers 1993: 11-12). Because of it, sets of words which are distinct elsewhere are homophones in Canada. In most of the United States, for example, the words listed below are distinguished from one another in this way:
21
  //
    //
    cot
     caught
    bobble
 bauble
    dotter
   daughter
    don
     dawn
     stocking
    stalking
  In these and dozens of other pairs of words, the phonological distinction does not exist in Canada, and the words in both lists have the same vowel. The vowel is usually (but not always) the unrounded [], so that cot and caught are both pronounced //, don and Dawn both //, and so on. For some Canadians, the vowel in both words is slightly rounded. What is distinctive is not the quality of the vowel but the fact that the vowel is the same in both words of the pairs.
It is noteworthy that this merger is spreading rapidly in the United States at the present time. Labov (1991a: 30-32) sketches the geographic distribution of the merger throughout Canada and the western States with a midwestern transition zone cutting across Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, the Texas panhandle, and angling southward to California. If the rate of change continues for another generation or two, the merger will be established as a general North American feature rather than distinctively Canadian (Chambers 1999). Mergers are favoured over splits in language change, and the spread of this merger provides an instance in which a Canadian feature is disseminating southward into the large, domineering country.
The second distinctive phonological feature of CE is allophonic rather than phonemic, and in that respect is structurally less significant, but it is nevertheless more salient as a marker of the Canadian accent. Many astute listeners distinguish Canadians from other North Americans by their pronunciations of words like wife, mice, right and, especially, house, couch, and about. Canadians pronounce the diphthongs in these words in a singular way, so that outsiders sometimes claim that they are saying, for example, aboot the hoose for „about the house.‟ That perception is not phonetically accurate, but what they are noticing is the higher vowel at the onset of the diphthong. The process is called Canadian Raising (Chambers 1973). . . .
Exactly how this feature originated in CE is uncertain. One certainty is that a similar diphthong with raised onset occurs very generally in Scots English, not only in words
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader

like wife, mice and right and house, couch and about but also in words like mine and foul (where it never occurs in Canadian speech). The Scots have been a constant presence in Canada ever since the English language came to be spoken there. One plausible explanation is that Canadian Raising came about by adapting the Scots vowel into the Canadian sound system (Trudgill 1984, Chambers 1989).
4. Vocabulary
Even before Canada had a significant and widespread population, many distinctive features of the Canadian vocabulary came into being. Explorers and adventurers learned the names of all the places they visited from the natives, and in many cases the native names stuck. Canadian place-names resound with words from the native language stocks: from east to west, Pugwash, Buctouche, Miscouche, Kejimkujik, Chicoutimi, Saguenay, Temagami, Napanee, Ottawa, Moosonee, Coboconck, Oshawa, Mississauga, Kakabecka, Wawa, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Ponoka, Wetaskiwin, Squamish, Esquimault, Nanaimo, and in the north, Tuktoyaktuk and Iqaluit, to cite just a few. Other place-names, scarcely less exotic, translate native names: Medicine Hat, Moose Jaw, Red Deer, Kicking Horse Pass, Yellowknife, Whitehorse, among them. Some places had more than one name because the indigenous name contended with an imperial one: Toronto was called York after the nondescript duke who was George III‟s second son, but in the end—since 1834—the Mohawk name, Toronto, meaning „trees standing in water,‟ prevailed.
Indigenous plants and animals usually kept their native names, such as tobacco, potato, tamarack, skunk, raccoon, beaver, grizzly (bear), moose, and caribou. The European adventurers were novices in the wilds, and those who survived were the ones who availed themselves of native know-how and materials: they learned to use foodstuffs such as pemmican, weapons such as tomahawks, watercraft such as kayaks, and apparel such as anoraks, mukluks, and moccasins. Because the first explorers were often Québecois, a number of French terms attached themselves permanently to forest and plain: prairie, portage, bateau, snye (< chenail „channel‟).
As the population of the country grew with the influxes described earlier, the distinctive vocabulary grew with it. When the land in Upper and Lower Canada was surveyed into lots for the first settlers, the main survey lines, usually 1.25 miles apart, were called concessions, the French term, and country roads along them are called concession roads. In Ontario, the secondary roads that intersect concessions are called side roads.
Some of the earliest political terms used in Canada were either obscure terms in England or became obsolete there, so their perpetuation in Canada and the meanings they took on make them unique. Among these are reeve as the political head of a township, a riding as an electoral district, acclamation as the election of a candidate without opposition, and shiretown as the government seat in Nova Scotia counties.
English in Canada, J.K. Chambers
22

One obvious area for vocabulary development comes from terms for technological innovations. Because the settlement of North America took place before the Industrial Revolution, the North American and the British branches of the language almost always developed different vocabularies for talking about machines. The automobile provides a well-known example: British English has bonnet for North American hood, boot for trunk, estate car for station wagon, windscreen for windshield, hooter for horn, and so on. Similarly, British English has lift for North American elevator, pavement for sidewalk, rates for taxes, lorry for truck, coach for bus, and numerous other differences in names for post-colonial developments.
Though the southern hemisphere colonies were also populated before the automobile and other technologies came into being, those colonies were still tied so closely to England that they adopted the British terms. Thus in the lexicon as well as in phonology, their closer link to the English of England is evident, and the distinctiveness of the North American branch from them is further defined.
5. Syntax
In matters of syntax, CE generally conforms to world-wide standards. Most regional variants are traceable to Old World sources.11 For example, the Hibernian completive construction after + present participle is heard in Newfoundland (Clarke 1997, Shorrocks 1997) and in rural areas around Port Hawkesbury, Ottawa, Peterborough, and no doubt other Canadian-Irish enclaves (Chambers 1986: 8-9). Sentences such as Mary‟s after telling us about it, meaning that Mary has recently finished telling us, are exotic to most Canadians, though not to all.12
One construction that occurs in standard Canadian syntax and also in some parts of the United States, perhaps all, is the ever exclamation, in constructions like Does John ever drive fast! and Is John ever stupid! The meaning is highly emphatic, signifying, in these
11 In other words, standard English grammar varies little from country to country, and where there are nonstandard grammatical constructions in CE, they are usually not Canadian innovations but carryovers from regional dialects in the British Isles.—Eds.
12 The standard present perfect tense consists of HAVE + past participle: I have called. The Hibernian, or Irish, “after perfect,” a grammatical construction influenced by Gaelic, consists of BE + after + present participle: I’m after calling. The meaning is “I have just recently called,” not “I am hoping or intending to call,” as Canadians outside Irish- influenced dialect areas might guess.—Eds.

instances, that John drives incredibly fast and that he is astoundingly stupid. The ever in the exclamations has or once had the meaning „habitually, at all times‟ as in forever „for all time‟. The syntax, oddly, is the same as for Yes/No questions, requiring auxiliary inversion or do-support, but the intonation is falling, not rising, and there is no sense of interrogation implied (Chambers 1986: 9-10).
One construction that has so far been reported only in CE is the ‟cep‟fer complementizer (Chambers 1987). . . . introducing a subordinate clause, as in We could sit on the floor ‟cep‟fer the teacher would probably tell us not to. The complementizer seems obviously to be a phonological reduction of except for, which has long been used as a preposition (We‟re all here except for Tom) but not heretofore as a complementizer. This usage is common in the speech of young Canadians, but there is anecdotal evidence that it is not peculiarly Canadian. Rather, it appears to be on the rise in the United States and perhaps elsewhere.
The most salient piece of dialect grammar found in CE is positive any more. This construction is fairly well studied in the United States (Eitner 1949, Labov 1991b, Murray 1993), though its provenance and exact distribution remain mysterious. In standard grammar the world over, the adverbial any more occurs freely in negative contexts, as in Mary doesn‟t listen to rock any more. In a relatively small region, any more can also occur in a positive context, as in John listens to rock a lot any more. Positive any more is linguistically interesting for many reasons. Perceptually, it causes extraordinary comprehension problems for people whose grammars do not include it; the sentence above simply means that John listens frequently to rock nowadays and it includes the necessary implication that he formerly did not and the incidental implication that the speaker probably does not fully approve. (Even some speakers who are users of positive any more fail to recognize it in citation forms and misconstrue its meaning.)
Geographically, users of positive any more are plentiful in the United States in the Atlantic seaboard region of Pennsylvania, and they are found in decreasing numbers in the inland regions settled from there. In Canada, positive any more occurs sporadically in Southern Ontario speech and then much more sporadically across western Canada (Chambers 2008: 9-11). In other words, it occurs in the region settled by Loyalists, as described in § 2.3 above, and it was carried westward with the Ontario homesteaders, as described in §2.6 above. As such, it is a remarkable linguistic vestige of settlement history going back more than two centuries.
6. Semantics
Apart from the meanings associated with the grammatical constructions described above, CE offers little of linguistic interest in terms of indigenous semantics. In most respects, peculiar Canadian meanings share their peculiarities with America at large, thus underlining again the global split between North American and British varieties.
24
 English in Canada, J.K. Chambers

Most such Americanisms are well known: words like store, sick, fix and guess have generalized their meanings to include what the British mean by shop, ill, repair and suppose. Regional meanings are abundant in Newfoundland, as might be expected, with fish for cod, ballicatter for the icy fringe on a shoreline, fiddler for someone who plays the accordion, horse‟s fart for a puffball, and dozens more, all beautifully documented in Story, Kirwin and Widdowson (1982; for other provincial vocabularies, see Pratt 1988, Pratt and Burke 1998).
In nation-wide use but peculiarly Canadian are hundreds of words and uses which arise from Canadian predilections, including deke (to feint), bang-bang (quick, successive actions), house league (a group of teams housed in one arena), all from hockey, or „ice hockey‟ as it is called outside Canada; skunky (for tainted beer), salt as a verb (to apply ice-remover to, as in salt the steps), and expressions such as done like dinner (utterly defeated) and pinch of coonshit (valueless). These meanings and numerous others are recorded, many for the first time, in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary (Barber 1998).
7. Media Use of English
Canada has a federally funded national broadcasting arm called the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), with both television and radio branches, including short-wave transmissions to Canadian military installations overseas. As a federal institution, the CBC is constitutionally bilingual. The form it takes is actually divided, with English-language and French-language (called Societé Radio-Canada) networks independent of one another under the aegis of the Ministry of Culture. Virtually all regions of the country can receive broadcasts in both languages. In addition, there are two private-enterprise national television networks, both English.
Newspapers use the language of their communities. For example, Toronto has three daily newspapers, all English, and Québec City has two, both French. Of the major cities in the French-English bilingual belt, Ottawa has three dailies, two English and one French, and Montréal has four, one English and three French. All major cities publish newspapers and broadcast in various immigrant languages as well as the official languages.
8. Literature in English
Canadian literary tradition is long and distinguished. One of the great English-language literary hits of the first half of the 19th century—an international bestseller before such a concept existed—was the work of Thomas Chandler Haliburton (1796-1865), a third- generation Canadian from Halifax who wrote eleven volumes of stories about an itinerant clock salesman in Nova Scotia in 1835-55. Haliburton‟s salesman, Sam Slick, was prized by readers in England, Scotland and the United States as well as Canada for his tall tales and worldly wisdom. Haliburton represented Slick‟s dialogue in a full-blown,
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader
25

authentic Yankee accent, and the novelty of this literary dialect helped to usher in the use of dialect in fiction that culminated a few decades later in the work of Thomas Hardy and Mark Twain.
Linguistically, Haliburton‟s writings provide the fullest record available of pre- Confederation accent, and have thus attracted the attention of dialectologists (Bailey 1981, Avis 1969). A few other literary works have also attracted linguistic attention. Robert Traill Spence Lowell, brother of James Russell Lowell, wrote a novel The New Priest of Conception Bay, set in Newfoundland in 1858; Hiscock (1977) separates features used to represent the five accents of the book, including Newfoundland English and Newfoundland Anglo-Irish. Ralph Connor‟s rambling novels (1901-34) set in Glengarry County in eastern Ontario represent a mélange of accents in the Ottawa Valley setting; Pringle (1981) discusses Connor‟s method of representing dialect and puts the various accents in their historical places. Percy Janes‟s novel House of Hate represents the dialogue of four generations in non-standard Newfoundland English, which has been described linguistically by Shorrocks and Rodgers (1993).
Though Canadian literature was in thrall to British models in the 19th century, it grew progressively independent from then on. Canadian literary critics seem to believe that there is a distinctive Canadian voice in the country‟s mainstream literary tradition. Northrop Frye (1971: 132) said, „No one who knows the country will deny that there is something, say an attitude of mind, distinctively Canadian, and while Canadian speech is American, there is a recognizable Canadian accent in the more highly organized speech of its poetry.‟ Such a claim is sociolinguistic if it has any meaning at all, and it could perhaps be elucidated or in some way concretized by linguistic evidence. That is not, however, a task that either linguists or literary critics seem inclined to take on. In Canada as elsewhere, applications of sociolinguistic methods to literature are largely untried.
The novel most readily cited as an emblem of Canada‟s French-English tensions is Hugh MacLennan‟s Two Solitudes (1945), which focuses on personal conflicts in Montréal, with battle lines clearly drawn on a linguistic plane. MacLennan‟s novel can be read as an attempt at dramatizing the ethnic and linguistic segregation within Montréal, which Lieberson (1965, 1970) charted sociologically about a quarter of a century later. But even the most sympathetic readers of Two Solitudes today are bound to notice that MacLennan‟s characters are dim stereotypes of a bygone era. They include Fr. Beaubien, a symbol of the reactionary Québec clergy: „The priest envisioned the whole of French Canada as a seed-bed for God, a seminary of French parishes speaking the plain old French of their Norman forefathers, continuing the battle of the Counter- Reformation.‟ Huntly McQueen, the shadowy financier, stands for the maudits anglais: „Being an Ontario Presbyterian, he had been reared with the notion that French- Canadians were an inferior people, first because they were Roman Catholic, second because they were French. Eighteen years of living in Montreal had modified this view, but only slightly.‟
English in Canada, J.K. Chambers
26

The Beaubiens and the McQueens have long since disappeared if they ever existed. Even MacLennan renounced them in his last years. „I found it the easiest book I ever wrote,‟ he said (Ross 1987), „probably because I didn‟t know enough about the problems.‟ More abiding than the novel itself is the title‟s image of „two solitudes,‟ which resonates in Canadian consciousness more deeply than the amateurish novel that coined it. The continuing retrenchment of the francophone population in the province of Québec (discussed in §1.3.5 above) brings with it the threat that the „two solitudes‟ will become complete isolates unless the federal policy of bilingualism softens the provincial insularity.
Linguistic conflicts occupy modern Canadian novelists much more than class conflicts, which are the bedrock of fiction-writing in the traditions of most other nations. Social class is scarcely noticed in novels set in anglophone Canada, except for the early novels of Robertson Davies, which are unconvincingly Canadian anyway because they are so freighted with late-Victorian British conventions and pretensions. More common are tensions between nonstandard „country‟ speakers and urban standard speakers. In The Stone Angel (1968), Margaret Laurence‟s first novel set in Manawaka, a fictitious region of Manitoba, both her main character Hagar Shipley and Hagar‟s husband Bram are native Manawakans but Bram is said to be „common as dirt.‟ At one point (1968: 71), Bram says, „Look, Hagar—this here one is half the price of that there one.‟ Hagar responds, „This here. That there. Don‟t you know anything?‟ And Bram says, „I talk the way I talk, and I ain‟t likely to change now.‟ In Ernest Buckler‟s The Mountain and the Valley (1952), set in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, half the continent away from Manawaka, the same conflict surfaces in dozens of incidents, as David Canaan, a young Werther in overalls, rails about the constraints imposed upon him by the backward Valley society though in the end he chooses to remain there. At one point, David attempts to run away by hitching a ride with some „city folk‟ (1952: 169). Of his casual conversation during the ride, he muses, „They were communicating with him. They were all talking as if they were all alike. He talked to them their way. There was nothing angular about their speech.‟ As David grows older, he notices the Valley changing around him (1952: 229): „And the people lost their wholeness, the valid stamp of their indigenousness.... In their speech, (freckled with current phrases of jocularity copied from the radio), and finally in themselves, they became dilute.‟
Both Laurence and Buckler were dramatizing the tensions that accompanied the urbanization of Canada in the first half of the 20th century, including the spread of the standard dialect. MacLennan dramatized the insularity of an urban area split by, among other things, two languages. These authors are not alone by any means, and Canadian literature offers a largely unexplored lode of social lore that might elucidate and to some extent validate the social implications of linguistic research in a nation where vastness and regionality make generalizations difficult.

9. Current Trends
The two immigration waves of the 20th century, as mentioned in §2.2 above, peaked around 1910 and 1960, but it is probably more realistic to think of them as one continuous immigration briefly interrupted by the two world wars. These immigrations effectively wiped out the Anglo-Celtic hegemony that was the heritage of the earlier immigrations. Nevertheless, the essential features of CE descend directly from the Loyalist base. The most obvious developments in the language in the last 30 or 40 years appear to augment it without altering its basic character.
As we have seen, the oldest vocabulary imported words from Inuits, Indians, and coureurs de bois. Most of those words were necessary because the word-stock of European languages provided no equivalents for the actions and objects they named. But this importation of words is not an isolated or strictly historical event. Exactly the same thing is happening today, for exactly the same reasons, and it is happening at an unprecedented rate.
The broader base of Canadian ancestry as a result of recent immigrations influences daily affairs in many ways. One of the more pervasive is gustatory. New foodstuffs require names, and most of them retain their „foreign‟ name not just for convenience but also for the sake of fashion: caffe latte, cappuccino, vermicelli, linguini, and countless other items of Italian cuisine, salsa from Mexico, sushi and teriyaki from Japan, dim sum from China, souvlaki, saganaki, gyros, taramasalata, and other Greek items, shish kebab from Turkey, falafels and pita from the Middle East, and samosa and nan from India. In a few cases, loanwords from two or more different languages mean the same thing, and CE ends up with synonyms: hence brochette (from French), satay (from Indonesian), shish kebab (from Turkish) and souvlaki (from Greek) are all names for meat roasted on a skewer; smorgasbord (from Swedish) and buffet (from French) both name meals where diners serve themselves from a communal board. If the foreign names are considered too difficult to pronounce, descriptive terms are sometimes substituted: so sautéed zhou dzi (fried dumplings) are usually called pot-stickers in Chinese restaurants. As loanwords come into common use, they occur with CE phonology (gyros, for instance, sounds like „heroes‟)13 and grammar (teriyaki is an adjective preceding nouns like steak or chicken, cappuccino is pluralized regularly as cappuccinos). From a historical viewpoint, by accommodating foreign words of all kinds, CE is simply perpetuating a venerable English tendency.
13 The English sound system does not contain the modern Greek consonant transliterated g, which means that CE speakers must improvise. Some pronounce gyro (roast meat on pita) with an initial /h/ (hero), others with an initial /j/ (as in year), while still others use // in a spelling pronunciation that rhymes with Cairo and is patterned on gyration.—Eds.
English in Canada, J.K. Chambers
28
 
That ancient tendency has never been exercised more vigorously than now, when the Canadian vocabulary—indeed, the vocabulary of every modern nation—is swelling more rapidly than ever with words from technology, medicine, international politics, and many other sources. Gigabyte, best-before dates, PMS, quark, glasnost, sexism, ageism, auto-immunity—these words and numerous others were coined recently, but they are already known and used in most parts of the world.
The adoption of words like these on an international scale is itself a recent linguistic phenomenon. Less than a century ago, technological and cultural innovations were much more likely to give rise to different (or partly different) vocabularies in widely separated places, as we saw in the distinctive British and American automobile vocabulary. The reason for the global spread of terms like these is the accessibility of formerly remote regions by modern communications.
Exactly the same kind of adoption is taking place at deeper structural levels as well, and for the same reason. Standard CE is undergoing changes in phonology and grammar so rapidly that there appears to be a headlong rush to re-form the language at the millennium. Using a method known as Dialect Topography for gathering sociolinguistic dialect data rapidly and efficiently (Chambers 1994), we have amassed enormously detailed information about CE in the 1990s (for instance, Chambers 1995, 1998b, Easson 1999, Chambers and Heisler 1999, Chambers 2000). In all the changes in progress we have charted, there is a common pattern. A form with a long history as a minor variant in CE comes into increasing use by younger speakers to the point where, for the youngest group, the teenagers, it has become not only the major variant but sometimes virtually the only form they use. Lexically, this is happening with the replacement of the Canadianism chesterfield by couch (Chambers 1995), and of serviette by napkin; phonetically, with the replacement of [] in the stressed syllable of leisure by [ij]; phonemically, with the replacement of [hw] by unaspirated [w] in words like where, when and whale, and the loss of yod [j] as an onset of the diphthongs in words like duke, tune and news;14 morphologically, with the replacement of past tense forms dived and sneaked by dove and snuck (all the above, and more, are discussed in detail in Chambers 1998b). . . .
These and other changes have sometimes been attributed to the reshaping of CE based on the American model (for instance, Nylvek 1992, Clarke 1993, Woods 1993). Not surprisingly, American cultural and economic intrusion is a perpetual fear in Canada, and Canadians routinely attribute changes in Canadian culture and society to it, even in
14 In other words, more Canadians are saying nooz rather than nyooz, toon rather than tyoon, and so on.—Eds.
29

the absence of concrete evidence. Fuller information from the Dialect Topography project and other sources shows that attributing the CE changes to Americanization oversimplifies what is really happening. In coming to an understanding of the motivation for these considerable changes, the linguistic evidence leads us into a consideration of some of the cataclysmic social changes of our time.
10. The future
The main historical thrust of the last fifty years, in the broadest perspective, has been the compression of space and time. Rail and sea travel are supplanted by air travel and jet propulsion, postal and telegraph communication by fax and e-mail, gas and electrical cooking by microwave, radio and phonography by television and laser disk, abacuses and adding machines by calculators and computerized spreadsheets, short wave antennae by satellites, scalpels by laser beams, carbon copies by photocopies, linotype by photo-plates, stroboscopic motion pictures by virtual reality. In 1964, when Marshall McLuhan said that the world was becoming „a global village,‟ his words had the ring of science fiction. Now, a few decades later, they seem very close to the literal truth.
Such global proximity will inevitably affect the way we speak. The consequences are not yet visible (or audible), but it is possible to project from discernible trends into the future. One likely result is that the various and different standard Englishes in Canada, the United States, England, Australia, Scotland, and elsewhere will someday be superseded by an accent that is somehow neutral with respect to all of them. Sociolinguists are beginning to understand some of the necessary conditions that would give rise to an oceanic English.
On the one hand, we know for certain that accents are not transmitted by mass media. Listeners or viewers can be exposed to endless hours of speech on radio or television without significantly changing their own accents or grammars (Chambers 1998d). They may adopt some vocabulary items, and they may develop a tolerance for the media accent and even an admiration for the users of the accent, but they still sound like themselves. For that reason, Newfoundlanders in the outports, for instance, have retained their indigenous accents after more than fifty years of hearing mainland accents daily on the CBC.15
On the other hand, we know for certain that accents are altered by face-to-face interactions between peers. People who move from one end of the country to the other come to sound—more or less—like their new work-mates or playmates. Their proficiency in the new accent is determined partly by age. For people over 14, the
15 See Gerard Van Herk, Becky Childs and Jennifer Thorburn, “Identity Marking and Affiliation in an Urbanizing Newfoundland Community,” this volume, for the varying effects of changing social conditions on outport accents.—Eds.
English in Canada, J.K. Chambers
30
 
adopted accent will always be less than perfect, so that they will never sound exactly like natives even though they come to sound quite unlike the people they moved away from; for people under seven, their adopted accent will sound just like the natives; and for people in between seven and 14 it is impossible to predict how fluent they will become. The inception of an oceanic English depends, therefore, upon close interaction among young people, and for that to happen the globe will have to become even smaller.
The global standard may be some years off, but one of its harbingers is already discernible. It appears that at the beginning of the 21st century there is a new continental standard coming into being in North America. Some of the changes in CE noted in the preceding section appear to be motivated by the formation of the new standard. CE is participating along with every other region of the North American continent in the shaping of a superordinate standard dialect.
There are at least four clear indications that this is what is happening, all of them copiously supported by age-correlated data on specific variables from a large, representative population (Chambers 1998b: 31-33).
First, the variants that are on the rise in Canada are sometimes associated with American English but they have had some currency in CE as far back as the historical record goes. Three changes that incontrovertibly favour American variants are the lexical replacements couch and napkin and the /i:/-variant of leisure. Other variants on the rise are not endemically American by any definition. Though the international ascendancy of snuck is not documented, it is apparently gaining ground outside North America as well as inside. Yod-dropping and WH-loss, beyond any doubt, are on the increase virtually everywhere English is spoken and in all the standard accents except Scots. These changes in CE are no more American-based than are the same changes taking place right now in, say, New Zealand or England.
Second, some of the American variants that are increasing in Canada are also increasing in American regions as well. In the replacement of dived by dove, for instance, young Canadians are adopting the form that is used by Americans across the border from Canada in New York state. But on closer consideration it becomes clear that in doing so they are not choosing the American variant. Exactly the same change is taking place in Texas English and other southern American varieties (Bernstein 1994), where dove never occurred before. The younger Texans are replacing dived with dove as the past tense form of the verb exactly as the young Canadians are. So Texas English and Canadian English are both adopting a variant that was formerly a minor one. In doing so, Canada is no more „Americanizing‟ than is Texas.
Third, other variables with long-standing status as American-Canadian shibboleths
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader
31

appear to be persisting without any change whatever. The stable and venerable American-Canadian distinctions include, for instance, pronunciation differences such as the past tense shone with /o/ (as in bone) in the United States and // (as in Shawn) in Canada and vase with // (as in Oz) in Canada and /e:/ (as in days) in the States, and lexical differences such as Canadian running shoes for American sneakers and Canadian tap for American faucet. So far, we have identified eight pronunciation differences and five lexical differences that are persisting with no sign of change at the border (Easson 1999). The Canadian-American border remains a dialect boundary.
Fourth, some of the changes spreading in North America are exactly contrary to Americanization. Instead, some endemically Canadian features are on the rise in American regions. . . . Most notably, the merger of the low back vowels // and // is spreading rapidly in the United States, as discussed in §3 above. The spread of these features could lead someone to conclude that American English is Canadianizing, but we know better. In reality, they are converging.
As the North American standard language takes shape, the old regionalisms remain to some extent: varieties such as Southern, Northern, New England, Texas and Canadian remain identifiable by the presence and persistence of certain features. On top of those regional standards is a new variety or at least a developing variety in which a set of variants is shared or coming to be shared across a large region. That region apparently covers the continent, and it may spread much further. It appears that the new standard will be marked by a constellation of features from several North American varieties. Some of them will be Northern features like dove for dived, but not all of them will be. Because mergers are favored in linguistic changes, the low back vowel merger— standard in Canada since the beginning of the historical record—will be one of them.
These features and others are regularizing across a large area in North America presumably under the influence of increased mobility that brings people from disparate regions into face-to-face contact with unprecedented frequency. The changes in CE appear to be adjustments similar to those that are reshaping many middle-class varieties in North America.
Now that Canada has become post-colonial both historically and spiritually, CE is likely to undergo a great many linguistic changes. They will come not only from global networking. Modern technology extends our reach around the globe, but in another sense the globe has come to Canada. The largest cities and towns are cosmopolitan; they make neighbours of people of diverse creeds and colours. The majority of the Canadian population no longer traces its ancestry to either the Loyalists or the British Isles. The integration of diverse peoples into the social fabric will have subtle effects just as the integration of the Scots and English did in the 1850s.

‘‘And then one day I walked down the street and I realized that I felt like a minority. I felt like I was an English-speaking part of a group of Montreal and Quebec and that I was actually a minority. And it was the strangest feeling to be inside Canada that’s English, but inside Quebec that’s French. Inside Montreal or this area in English, and still be a minority inside of a majority.’’
(QEC/MTL/174:739)1
 1. INTRODUCTION
Over the past 30 years, the unparalleled success of Quebec’s language laws and the resulting ‘‘anglophone exodus’’ (Castonguay 1998:41) have fundamentally altered the relationship of English and French in the province.
This research was supported by SSHRC grant # 410-2002-0941 [2002–2005] to Poplack and Walker. For assistance and advice with fieldwork, we thank L. Hanrahan, J. Hobbs-Robert, K. Hocking, K. Macdonald, and R. Walling in Quebec City; R. Fatta, F. Genesee, B. Golden, C. Milo, F. Nagalie, S. Poplack, P. Thibault, and M. Tobin in Montreal; B. and M. Malcolmson in Oshawa; and D. and S. Anderson in Whitby. Transcription and correction were carried out by a peerless team spearheaded by R. Malcomson, M. Love, and E. Mayberry. N. Dion and the research assistants at the University of Ottawa Sociolinguistics Laboratory contributed in a variety of capacities to the research reported here. We are grateful to all the anglophones in Quebec and Ontario who shared their experiences with us.

The received wisdom is that English, qua minority language, has undergone contact-induced language change (Palmer 1995; Chambers and Heisler 1999), an outcome deemed worthy of front-page press coverage.2 To date, however, there has been surprisingly little scientific evidence to support these claims. Much of the available literature (Fee 1991; Grant-Russell 1999; Hamilton 1975; McArthur 1992; Palmer and Harris 1990; Russell 1997) is preoccupied with gallicisms, the familiar catalogue of French lexical incorporations (e.g., de ́panneur, autoroute, vernissage) assumed to be unique to Quebec English (QcE). These lists tend to be based on newspaper searches, to the neglect of the spoken language, where linguistic change originates and spreads.
Two assumptions of this research tradition bear revisiting. One involves change: the infiltration of gallicisms is widely considered to be on the rise (Grant-Russell 1999; Manning and Eatock 1983; Palmer and Harris 1990), yet with the exception of Palmer and Harris (1990), no explicit comparison of an earlier or pre-contact stage of English has been offered. The second implies that lexical manifestations of contact function as agents of structural change, an idea with no basis in scientific fact. Systematic research on nearly a dozen pairs of languages in contact (Poplack et al. 1988; Sankoff et al. 1990; and the papers in Poplack and Meechan 1998) reveals that, rather than changing the recipient-language grammar, borrowed items tend to be structurally adapted to it upon, or shortly after, their first use. Thus, while the lexicon of Quebec English may have been augmented through contact with French, we simply do not know whether this has affected its grammar.
In this paper we describe a large-scale project specifically designed to assess the impact of a majority language on the structure of the minority language in a situation of long-term contact. Focusing on spontaneous speech, we take a three-pronged approach. We investigate the existence and directionality of change (i) over (apparent) time, (ii) according to intensity of contact, and finally (though not the focus of this paper), (iii) by comparing variable linguistic structure, first among the contact varieties and then with that of the putative source: French.
In ensuing sections we detail the methods employed in selecting a sample and constituting a corpus suitable for this endeavour. We then characterize the speakers who participated in the project, as well as aspects of their speech. Finally, we illustrate the utility of the materials with an analysis of the sociolinguistic situation of the anglophone community in Quebec at the dawn of the 21st century, and a first empirical measure of the true impact of French lexicon on Quebec English.

2. CHOICE OF COMMUNITIES
To assess the contribution of language status (majority vs. minority) to contact-induced change, we compare the English spoken in three urban centres in which the proportion of English mother-tongue claimants varies widely: Quebec City (1.5%) and Montreal (12%) in the province of Quebec, and as a control, Oshawa-Whitby, a mid-sized, heavily anglophone (86%) region in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, with very few (2%) French mother-tongue claimants (Statistics Canada Census 2001). If hospitality to contact-induced change is a function of language status, its effects should be most apparent in Quebec City, where native anglophones have constituted a tiny minority at both the local and provincial levels since at least 1791 (Dickinson and Young 2003:70). The three locations qualify as urban centres, albeit of different sizes; thus ceteris paribus, residents should have at least some exposure to ongoing changes affecting other varieties of Canadian English. This enables us to assess the extent to which a minority language resists mainstream linguistic developments.
3. CHOICE OF INFORMANTS
Only anglophones born, raised, and currently residing in each respective city qualified for inclusion in the sample.3 Participants were stratified according to the time at which they acquired English: either prior to the political and social upheavals of the ‘‘Quiet Revolution’’ of the 1960s (when English was the dominant if not majority language in Quebec); or after the passage of the Charte de la langue franc ̧aise (1977), popularly known as Bill 101, which ratified French as the sole and official language of the province. The socio-demographic status of the communities sampled, coupled with the temporal comparison afforded by the informant stratification scheme, enables us to determine whether distinctions between the English of older and younger anglophones are due solely to internal evolution, or more specifically to the contact situation. The distribution of sample members according to city of residence and time they acquired English is displayed in Table 1.
Given the multi-ethnic nature of Montreal (Germain and Rose 2000), as well as evidence from previous studies (Guy et al. 1986; Horvath and Sankoff 1987; Knack 1991; Labov 1966; Labov 2001:224–260; Laferriere 1979) that established ethnic groups may participate in ongoing change to differing degrees, we further distinguished Montreal informants according
3Anglophone status was determined via informant self-identification during the initial recruitment phase.

  to three major ethnic origins: British (including English, Irish, and Scottish), Italian, and Jewish.4 No other stratification scheme was imposed at the sample constitution phase.
4. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE
Other explanatory variables include socio-demographic factors (age, sex, socio-economic status, occupation, educational attainment, linguistic market ranking), as well as other measures more pertinent to the contact situation: bilingual proficiency and affect toward French and francophones. These are described below.
4.1. Age and sex
As a result of the research design described above, most of the informants belong to two polar age groups. Table 2 shows that nearly half were aged 30 or younger at time of interview; 33% were over 65. The wide age differential should enhance the possibility of detecting linguistic change in apparent time, where operative.
4.2. Socio-economic status
Because the research communities were selected on the basis of the status of English in the environment, it was impracticable to control simulta- neously for socio-economic factors, in the manner of Labov (1966), Sankoff and Sankoff (1973), or Sankoff et al. (1976). By characterizing the approximate socio-economic status of each participant, however, we can nonetheless take account of this factor in our analyses. We infer this information from measures generally considered to be correlated with socioeconomic status: occupation, education, and linguistic market ranking (Sankoff and Laberge 1978).
4Ethnic categorization was based on informant self-identification.

  Based on the National Occupational Classification Matrix 2001 (Human Resources Development Canada 2001), speakers’ occupations (and/or those of their spouses or parents, where relevant) were categorized as highly skilled (usually requiring university education, e.g., professor, accountant, nurse), skilled (college or apprenticeship training, e.g., police officer, bookkeeper), moderately skilled (secondary school and/or occupational training, e.g., childcare worker, bus driver), and unskilled (on-the-job training, e.g., factory worker, handyman). Table 3 shows that the sample is heavily biased in favour of highly skilled individuals.
4.4. Educational attainment
Sample members also tend to be very highly educated (Table 4), with nearly two-thirds having obtained at least some post-secondary education.

190 CJL/RCL 51(2/3), 2006
4.5. Insertion into the linguistic market
As observed by Sankoff and Laberge (1978), the correlation of linguistically variable behaviour with social class membership ignores the fact that certain economic activities (e.g., teacher, receptionist) specifically require competence in the standard language. The insertion of individuals into the linguistic market is often more explanatory of actual linguistic behaviour than more abstract factors like social class membership (Sankoff et al. 1989). Following the methodology outlined by Sankoff and Laberge, sample members were ranked by a panel of trained judges according to the criterion of the ‘‘relative importance of the legitimized language in [their] socio-economic life’’ (1978:241). Note that despite the generally elevated occupational and educational levels displayed in Tables 3 and 4, only 9% of the sample report occupations which rate high on the linguistic market index (Table 5). Subsequent studies will reveal which of these factors, if any, accounts best for observed linguistic variability in Quebec English.
4.6. Proficiency and attitude measures
In conjunction with these standard sociolinguistic variables, speakers were characterized according to two additional parameters which are particu- larly relevant to contact-induced change: (reported) proficiency in French, as determined by scores on a Cumulative French Proficiency Index (CFPI),

and affect towards that language and culture, as assessed by scores on a Cumulative French Attitude Index (CFAI). Speakers with the highest scores on both indices may reasonably be predicted to show most susceptibility to contact-induced convergence, if any, with French.
4.6.1. Cumulative French Proficiency Index
The CFPI is calculated for each speaker on the basis of self-reports on a number of measures reflecting the vitality of French in his or her linguistic repertoire. These include (1) age and means of acquisition, (2) frequency of use, (3) degree of proficiency, and (4) language used with selected interlocutors. Each response was weighted according to its contribution to the overall strength of French. Thus, an individual who learned French spontaneously in early childhood would have scored higher on the acquisition measure than one who acquired it at a later age or in a formal institution. Likewise, use of French in the home was weighted more heavily than in the workplace. Scores were normalized by taking into account only those items mentioned by a speaker, each divided by the maximum strength for that item. Each individual was assigned an average score (over items mentioned) between 0 (no knowledge of French) and 1 (high proficiency).5 Table 6 displays the distribution of sample members according to reported proficiency in French, as emerges from the CFPI.
Reported proficiency is highly correlated with language status, instantiated both by location and time of acquisition of English. Note the perfect progression, from the Ontario control group, nearly all of whom report little or no knowledge of French, through the Montreal anglo- phones, 29% of whom assess their proficiency as mid-high to high, and to the 54% of Quebec City anglophones who report proficiencies in the mid- high to high ranges. Moreover, the post-Bill 101 generation consistently reports the highest proficiencies, with Quebec City youth in the lead.
4.6.2. Cumulative French Attitude Index
As part of the conversations constituting the interview, participants frequently expressed their opinions about their sociolinguistic situation, offering a window into their overall affect toward French. This, in turn, may help predict whether their English is likely to undergo linguistic influence from that language. To tap into this information, we conducted a content analysis of the corpus, grouping relevant remarks into six broad categories: reaction to the language laws, social consequences of language choice, the fate of the English language and culture in Quebec, anglophone-francophone relations, perceived value of the languages, and
5To ensure that statistical comparisons would be meaningful, the threshold for ‘‘high’’ was set at 0.6.

   linguistic manifestations of language contact. These constituted input to the CFAI, created following the same procedure described above with reference to the CFPI. Table 7 displays the distribution of sample members according to overall affect toward French, as emerges from the CFAI.
The overwhelming majority (92% of participants for whom scores could be calculated) scored in the highest range, indicating very positive affect towards the French language and francophones. Interestingly, this is independent of perceived proficiency (Table 8): those who espouse these attitudes are evenly distributed across proficiency cohorts.
5. CORPUS CONSTITUTION
Having characterized the speakers constituting the sample, we turn next to the speech data that make up the Quebec English Corpus (QEC). To maximize representation of the vernacular features characteristic of spontaneous, everyday speech (which include many manifestations of language contact), we adopted the ethnographically inspired methods of data collection detailed in Poplack (1989). To minimize the Observer’s Paradox (Labov 1972), anglophone fieldworkers were trained in admin- istering the ‘‘sociolinguistic interview’’ (Labov 1984), a collection of topics geared to elicit informal conversation.6 Interviews were recorded, with
6All fieldworkers were native speakers of Canadian English and most were members of the respective communities in which they collected data.

  participants’ consent, on Sony MD Walkman MZ-N707 Type-R minidisk recorders, using unobtrusive Sony ECM-T140 lavaliere microphones. The length of the session was determined by the participant, ranging from a low of one hour to a high of four hours. As is standard sociolinguistic practice, to ensure anonymity, informant names were replaced by speaker numbers and pseudonyms, and any identifying information was deleted. The resulting corpus contains 340 hours of speech, or 2,814,223 words, counting interventions of informants only.
5.1. Transcription
The data were transcribed from minidisk directly into computer files, using a protocol designed to maximize accessibility (Poplack 1989; Poplack and

194 CJL/RCL 51(2/3), 2006
St-Amand, in press; Poplack and Tagliamonte 1991). The overall strategy was to represent variation resulting from the operation of phonological processes in standard orthography regardless of actual phonetic realization (e.g., past-tense [mIst] and [mIs] were both transcribed missed). Variant forms resulting from the operation of other processes (morphological, syntactic, lexical), standard or not, were represented exactly as produced, as in (1).
(1) There’s more English people in the province of Quebec than there are people in Saskatchewan. (QEC/QC/059:1059)
French interventions in the text were likewise transcribed according to standard French orthography. In the few cases where idiosyncratic transcription devices were adopted, this was to distinguish high-frequency homographs (e.g., quotative and discourse marker like (N1⁄437,449) were transcribed lyke to avoid confusion with the verb and comparator (N 1⁄4 9,723)). Punctuation and spacing were used to treat fixed expressions or compounds as single units (you-know), or to separate productive contracted forms (do n’t) to facilitate their location in the alphabetical concordance. No other effort was made to edit or modify the form of this material in any way. Syntax, morphology, lexical choice, deletions, and insertions of all sorts, standard or non-standard, were scrupulously respected.
The time required to transcribe a single interview was a function not only of its length (interviews varied from 2,664 to 46,925 words), but also of its complexity in terms of number of participants, voice quality, noise level, and other imponderables. Correction time per interview varied from a maximum of 33 hours (for a 35,204-word interview) to a minimum of 2.5 hours. Thanks to a team of highly trained and efficient transcribers, transcription of the 2.8 million-word corpus was completed in 2,471 person-hours.7
5.2. Correction
Given the degree of precision required to represent accurately the inherent variability of spontaneous speech, the correction of a corpus of this size is a formidable task. Alternating transcribers and correctors at each pass, transcriptions underwent three independent correction phases: two in conjunction with the original audio recordings, and a third, from systematic wordlist scans. At this stage, native francophones also corrected any incorporations from French, flagging multiword code-switches, as

POPLACK, WALKER and MALCOLMSON 195
in (2), and indicating, from systematic consultation of the audio tapes, the language in which French/English homographs, as in (3), had been realized. The correction process took an additional 1,536 person-hours to complete.8
(2) I called him and you-know, asked him to go over and get me 5FR deux chiens-chauds, tout garnis.> [‘two hot dogs, all dressed’] (QEC/MTL/ 112:1055)
(3) The menace* [mœ’nas] certainly isn’t coming from, you know, the heart, from Quebec’s anglos. (QEC/QC/004:1361)
The corrected transcripts are input to data handling programs capable of creating wordlists, indices, and concordances of different configurations. These enable maximally efficient location and extraction of vast quantities of reliable data on most morphosyntactic variables without having to return to the original transcripts. This is of primordial importance for the large-scale studies of linguistic variation currently being carried out on the Quebec English Corpus.
5.3. Nature of the data
The resulting corpus of spoken Quebec English contains a wealth of narratives, opinions, and observations, as well as some of the linguistic manifestations of the contact situation we set out to study, including borrowings from French, as in (4), code-switches to French, as in (5), and the odd calque, as in (6).

(6) They came back to Canada and they- they got installed [5Fr s’installer ‘settle’] here. (QEC/QC/046:112)
The corpus also features many vernacular and colloquial features of English, such as be like quotatives, as in (7), null subjects, as in (8), progressives used with statives, as in (9), among many others, as well as more formal discourse (10). These features, all hallmarks of the spoken language, faithfully reflect the spontaneous speech of the participants in this study. The richness of the Quebec English Corpus in terms of the number and variety of linguistic forms represented (especially compared to the sources studied thus far in this connection) is evidence that it is

6. A SOCIOLINGUISTIC PROFILE OF QUEBEC ANGLOPHONES
In this section we present a sociolinguistic profile of the anglophones constituting the Quebec English Corpus, touching on their reported patterns of use of both English and French, their affect toward them and the sociolinguistic situation more generally, and their opinions about the effects that contact with French has had on their English.9
6.1. Reported English-use patterns
Figure 1 displays reported English-use patterns for all members of the sample. To better contextualize the anglophone Quebecers, we contrast them with the Ontario control group, whose linguistic behaviour appears consistent with that of typical monolinguals anywhere. All the Ontarians claim English as their first language, feel most comfortable in it, speak it daily, use it as their former and current home language, and speak it with family.
6.1.1. First language
In comparison, fewer Quebecers report English as their mother tongue, especially in Montreal (59%), where more individuals cite heritage languages (e.g., Yiddish, Italian) alone or in conjunction with English (32%). Figure 2, which breaks down these results by location and time of acquisition of English, shows that while all the older Quebec City residents claim English as their first language (L1), nearly half of their post-Bill 101 counterparts report both languages. In Montreal, we observe an opposing trend: English as a sole L1 has increased among the young speakers (79%), but at the expense of the heritage languages.
Thus, one effect of Bill 101, particularly palpable among younger Quebec City anglophones, is the acquisition of both English and French as

6.1.2.
Well there’s rarely just plain anglophones. Like there’s a few that I can think of, but not very many, who don’t speak French at all, at all. Most of my friends speak English and French very well, like depending with who they’re with. Like when I’m with my friends from school I speak English, when I’m with other friends I speak French, and it doesn’t really matter. (QEC/QC/031:249)

first languages, a hallmark of balanced bilingualism. This, parenthetically, is consistent with the difficulties some younger speakers experienced in identifying their language group, as illustrated in (11).
As for the language the speaker feels ‘‘most comfortable’’ in, almost all anglo-Quebecers also choose English. Figure 3 shows that the few who choose both English and French tend to be concentrated in Quebec City. Nonetheless, 100% of the younger generation, regardless of location, report speaking English daily.10
10Actually, all participants, with the exception of three elderly Quebec City residents, report speaking English daily.

 Figure 2: Informants’ first language, by location and time of acquisition of English
6.1.3. Home language over time
In terms of home language, current or childhood, while most older anglo- Quebecers cite English regardless of location, their younger counterparts are much more differentiated. English as the sole home language is decreasing in favour of both French and English in Quebec City, while the opposite is true in Montreal (Figures 4a and 4b). In Quebec City, Bill 101 has enabled French to penetrate personal domains such as the home, whereas Montrealers have responded by reinforcing English as the language of personal affect.
6.1.4. Language choice according to interlocutor
Likewise, comparison of reported language choice according to inter- locutor over time (Figure 5) shows that English has declined substantially in Quebec City; in Montreal, in contrast, it has barely diminished over the duration.
6.2. Reported French-use patterns
How does the perceived role of English compare with that of French? Figure 6 shows the reported French-use patterns for sample members.

POPLACK, WALKER and MALCOLMSON 199
 Figure 3: ‘‘Most comfortable’’ language, by location and time of acquisition of English
In Ontario, the role of French is consistent with that of a foreign language anywhere. Few (37%) claim the ability to speak it at all (and those, with qualifications), and all are born after 1977. Most of them acquired it formally, as a second language in an English-medium school. Only one speaker reports speaking French daily and considers herself bilingual. For these English Canadians, French has little impact on daily life. Almost all anglo-Quebecers, in contrast, report speaking French, with the post-Bill 101 generation in the lead in both locations.
Moreover, approximately 80% of the respondents report having acquired French at an early age, regardless of location (Figure 6).
As for means of acquisition, the geographic difference is quite evident. Many more Quebec City anglophones of both generations acquired French informally, whereas two-thirds of their Montreal counterparts report having learned it through formal instruction only. This may explain why twice as many Quebec City residents, regardless of generation, claim to speak French daily as compared to Montrealers (Table 9).
Given these reported-use profiles, it is not surprising that more than half of all anglophone Quebecers, especially the post-Bill 101 youth (including the entire Quebec City cohort) qualify themselves as bilingual.
Summarizing, speakers in both locations perceive that French has made inroads. Most not only claim to speak it, but report doing so daily,

and characterize themselves as bilingual. Young Quebec City speakers are in the lead. More of the latter also report having learned French informally, all consistent with the ubiquitous nature of the language, the relative homogeneity of the population, and the minority status of anglophones in the city.
Yet speaker reports on the role of English reveal that it too remains vital on each of the measures examined. In Montreal, there is evidence that

 Figure 5: Reported choice of English with interlocutors over time, by location
Figure 6: Reported French-use profile, by location
English is actually becoming more entrenched: more of the post-Bill 101 generation claim it as their first language and current home language, and continue to use it with a variety of interlocutors. Despite indications that French is beginning to infiltrate erstwhile preferred domains for English,

  particularly among Quebec City youth, crucially, it is not replacing it. Some younger speakers report having acquired French as an L1, feeling more comfortable using it, speaking it at home, and choosing it with a variety of interlocutors including family members, but this is for the most part in conjunction with, rather than in place of, English, which all the post-Bill 101 generation also speak daily. We conclude that French is not supplanting English.
6.3. Reported affect toward the sociolinguistic situation
Content analysis of the recorded conversations constituting the Quebec English Corpus also enabled us to characterize anglo-Quebecers’ views of the consequences of Bill 101, and from these, to assess their general affect toward the sociolinguistic situation in Quebec. Because not all participants commented on all issues, in what follows we review those issues which received most mentions, and which we may therefore infer to be most vital.
6.3.1. Reactions to the language laws
More than one-third of the participants (N 1⁄4 45)11 mentioned Bill 101, and at least two-thirds of these reacted negatively, with little difference due to location or generation. The main complaint targets the clause restricting access to English-medium public education to anglo-Quebecers who attended such schools themselves (12).
(12) So every parent, that is their goal, is that their children should do well. And the government’s trying to keep them back, because they want peasants. (QEC/MTL/140:415)
11The analysis in this section is based on a reduced sample of 140 informants. As detailed in section 4.6.2, the data discussed here derive from systematic content analysis of observations arising spontaneously during the course of the interview, not from direct responses to questions. Percentages are calculated on the basis of the total number of observations relevant to each measure.

(14)
6.3.2.
But bilingual is reality. And that’s what is not to be acknowledged. According to me. You don’t take out English signs and say to people, ‘‘You’re putting that in French, and if it’s in English, it’s 50% smaller’’. You don’t do that. Because then the English people are gonna have to what? Start squinting? (QEC/MTL/130:776)
Like Bill 101 was a necessity, it was a good thing...It made the rest of us get off our ass and learn French. (QEC/QC/033:933)
Language choice
POPLACK, WALKER and MALCOLMSON 203
All but two of the respondents were also against the unpopular signage laws requiring that French be prominent on bilingual signs, as in (13). Only a few individuals explicitly endorsed the original intent of the language legislation, as exemplified in (14).
More than one-third of the participants (N 1⁄4 52) commented on the consequences of choosing English as a language of public interaction, and all but three qualify them as negative, as in (15). Many report having been admonished when overheard speaking English, as in (16). In this context, a recurrent anecdote involves outwitting francophone bystanders with bilingual skills, as in (17).
(15) Refused to talk to me, made my life a living hell because I wouldn’t speak to her in French. (QEC/MTL/158:496)
(16) But then I walk down the street, and somebody looks at me funny or makes a comment because I’m speaking in English, and it’s frustrating because you just wanna turn around and say, ‘‘Well, I speak French too.’’ (QEC/MTL/129:367)
(17) So I remember a couple of old ladies on a city bus once when I was in junior high...I was sitting on a seat in front of them talking with one of my friends from school and all I remember hearing was ‘‘Ah, les maudits anglais, on les entend partout’’ [‘Damn anglophones, you hear them everywhere.’] And so I just turned around and I looked at the ladies and I said, ‘‘Est-ce que le fait que je parle en anglais, c ̧a vous de ́range? Parce que si vous voulez, je peux changer c ̧a tout de suite en franc ̧ais, si vous pre ́fe ́rez’’. [‘Does the fact that I’m speaking English bother you? Because if you want, I can change to French right now if you prefer.’] And both their jaws dropped, because I guess in their minds, you either speak French or you speak English, but you can’t speak both. And they got off at the next stop. (QEC/QC/071:135)
Most of those who mentioned language choice in service encounters (N 1⁄4 28) also reported difficulty in obtaining service in English. Yet paradoxically, elsewhere in the same conversations speakers report that they themselves tend not to initiate in English (66%), opting instead for French (60% of young Montrealers), as in (18), or both (67% of Quebec City youth).

204 CJL/RCL 51(2/3), 2006
(18) I always come into a store and speak in French first. (QEC/MTL/129:383)
Only among the older Quebec City cohort does a substantial proportion (50%) report initiating in English. When speakers do choose to initiate in English, the majority report being accommodated to (in English or both languages); and when they are addressed in French, they too reciprocate in that language. Some anglo-Quebecers even expressed indignation at the failure of fellow anglophones (or ‘‘allophones’’) to reciprocate in French (19).
(19)
6.3.3.
I get pissed off when I speak to a clerk in French and they answer me in English...I’ll switch to English no problem, but I’ll walk out of that store and I’ll look at the person I’m with, and I say, ‘‘Can you believe that? Not even a je ne parle pas franc ̧ais or bonjour’’!...Having grown up in Quebec in a French neighbourhood, that bothers me, that pisses me off. (QEC/MTL/129:384)
The fate of the English language and culture in Quebec
Nearly half the participants (N1⁄459) raised the issue of the anglophone exodus from Quebec, ascribing it mainly to the political situation, and to a lesser extent, to language issues and lack of employment opportunities for the young. Nearly two-thirds admit to having considered moving themselves, a sentiment which is especially pronounced among the post-Bill 101 generation (75%), regardless of location. Although the numbers are quite sparse here, it is clear that the language issue is the motivating factor for these youth. Only on the fate of the English community in Quebec are participants (N1⁄448) sharply split, with a strong majority of Montrealers (78%) evincing optimism as to its survival, as in (20), while only half as many anglo-Quebecers (40%) are of this opinion.
(20) I can’t imagine English ever disappearing...There are plenty of franco- phones who go to McGill so they can learn English. And there’s plenty of francophones, I mean, what are they watching on TV? A lot more anglophone programs than French. And what are the popular songs that they’re singing?...They’re anglophone. (QEC/MTL/160:1022)
These opposing sentiments have become even more strongly entrenched among the respective post-Bill 101 generations (rising to 89% for Montrealers versus 38% for Quebec City residents).
Notwithstanding, the minority status of anglophones, so eloquently exemplified in (21) as well as in the epigraph to this article, was invoked by relatively few informants (N 1⁄4 15), most of whom (60%) were Quebec City youth.

(21)
6.3.4.
Well, Montreal’s more English than it is here. Quebec is – English people are very big-time minority. So yeah, I mean the percentage of people here compared in Montreal, it’s like almost, you know, big-time marginal. (QEC/QC/062: 874)
Anglophone-francophone relations
POPLACK, WALKER and MALCOLMSON 205
More than half the participants (N 1⁄4 82) had occasion to raise the issue of anglophone-francophone relations. Although one-third reported that these had once been negative in both locations, these feelings appear to have diminished, since only a handful (N1⁄47) report any current animosity. Indeed, of the 54 individuals who commented on their personal relations with francophones, all report close familial or friendship ties.
6.3.5. Value of French and English
With respect to the perceived value of French and English, only a few participants invoked the advantages of speaking one or the other of the official languages. Most cited their instrumental value, as in (22), and only to a much lesser extent, affective value, as in (23). But more than half of the participants (N 1⁄4 79) invoked bilingualism, and all but one considered it an advantage, as in (24). (This is one of the few language-related issues on which the Ontario control group volunteered an opinion, and here too, all but one concurred that bilingualism is a positive attribute.) Moreover, informants from all three locations are overwhelmingly in favour of both linguistic groups achieving bilingualism.
(22) a. You know, like ‘cause here if you don’t speak French you can’t get a job, practically. I mean it’s very rare, a job that you can do just with English. (QEC/QC/072:211)
b. All of a sudden now she’s noticing. At the position she has, you know what? No English, no job, no dinero. (QEC/QC/073:1055)
(23) I understand like, why they would want to keep French, you know, it’s a beautiful language. (QEC/QC/076:1279)
(24) I think that the fact that you can speak two languages, and understand two languages and so many people do, it’s an opportunity for enlighten- ment. The more you know, the better person you are, you know? (QEC/MTL/145: 664)
6.4. Linguistic effects of language contact
Nearly one-third of the participants (N 1⁄4 42) mentioned the linguistic effects of language contact, in particular, language mixing. Very few, regardless of speaker cohort, displayed the prescriptive reaction expressed in (25). Rather, Quebec anglophones seem to accept mixing as a fact of

206 CJL/RCL 51(2/3), 2006
life, as illustrated in (26). Some, especially Montrealers, view it as a positive phenomenon, as expressed in (27).
(25) Just one language at a time, thank you very much! (QEC/MTL/124:1227)
(26) I don’t even notice when I do it. I can talk with one of my friends, we’d talk for hours and somebody could be counting how many times. They’d tell you, ‘‘Well, 34 times you changed languages’’. And I’d say, ‘‘I didn’t even
notice once!’’ (QEC/QC/031:1402)
(27) So it’s funny, ‘cause we’ll talk- and they’ll talk French, I’ll talk in English.
I’ll talk in French, they’ll talk- I mean, we’re talking and if I can’t think of a word, I’ll say it in English. If I can, I talk to them in French. You know, it’s interesting! (QEC/MTL/172:641)
Nearly half of the participants (N 1⁄4 62) discussed the issue of linguistic convergence, and the overwhelming majority (79–83%, depending on speaker cohort) believe that French is influencing English. Of those who elaborated (N 1⁄4 45), nearly all (89–97%) cited the lexicon as the area most affected, as in (28), though many were hard-pressed to provide specific examples.
(28) Well, you’ll change a vocabulary word. And it’s the same thing. Like I remember the other day I had the word ascenseur in my head all day. I swear it took me two hours to figure out what the hell was ascenseur in English. Well, it’s an elevator, of course. (QEC/QC/056:894)
Summarizing, in the aggregate, the anglo-Quebecers we have studied profess generally negative opinions of Bill 101, especially as concerns the controversial medium-of-education and signage clauses. Language choice is a widespread concern, and nearly all describe the consequences of choosing English in the public domain as negative. This may well be why so many (with the exception of some older Quebec City residents) report initiating in French. Contrasting with these negative assertions is the very positive picture that emerges from more subjective measures. Thus, the advantages of bilingualism were widely invoked, and anglophone- francophone relations were characterized as overwhelmingly good, with many reports of close personal ties. This type of situation should be conducive to linguistic convergence.
Indeed, a strong majority, regardless of location or time of acquisition of English, concurred that French had changed English, with Quebec City youth again in the lead. Almost all speakers pinpoint the lexicon as the single most important area of influence. Younger Quebec City speakers also cited code-switching as another manifestation of the contact situation. How do speaker perceptions of the impact of French on English compare with their actual usage of the two languages in discourse? Positive attitudes toward French, coupled with the high degrees of proficiency in that

POPLACK, WALKER and MALCOLMSON 207
language reported by these same individuals (sections 6.1 and 6.2), should render English more permeable to contact-induced change, especially amongst the apparently most vulnerable group: the post-Bill 101 generation of Quebec City. In the next section we test this hypothesis with a quantitative measure of the impact of French on Quebec English.
7. THE ROLE OF FRENCH IN QUEBEC ENGLISH
Because language mixing is so salient to linguists, laypeople, and the participants in this study, in this section we consider its two major manifestations: borrowing, here defined as the incorporation of lone French-origin items into otherwise English discourse, as in (29), and code-switching, or the alternation between multiword fragments of French and English in discourse, as in (30).
(29) So the way it worked with her Master’s, it was like two months in school, ten months stage [ [staZ] ‘work term’], which was like a paid stage. And two months in school again. (QEC/MTL/212:370)
(30) She kept me there for about ten minutes, ‘til the man behind me says, ‘‘C’est donc ridicule!’’ [‘This is ridiculous!’] (QEC/QC/006/1600)
We first note that use of borrowed items is surprisingly rare, especially in view of the highly propitious contact situation described above. Contrary to speaker reports in (25)–(28), the number of loanwords per interaction ranges from none at all (22% of the sample) to a (rare) 41. To contextualize these figures, consider that the individual who uttered 41 borrowed tokens also produced 9,314 words which were not borrowed in the same interview, meaning that borrowed vocabulary represents only 0.44% of her lexicon.12
Table 10 displays the distribution of sample members according to the proportion of their total vocabulary that borrowed items represent. It is clear that French lexical items have made virtually no inroads into the English lexicon; they represent no more than 0.23% of the vocabulary of the 10% of the sample who make even marginal use of borrowed vocabulary, and substantially less for everyone else. Finer analysis (Poplack et al., in preparation) reveals that their true impact is in fact far smaller than implied by these figures.
Studies of bilingual communities (Poplack 1985, 2001, 2004) have taught us that there are many different ways of combining languages in
12These calculations exclude ‘‘established’’ loanwords, here defined as French- origin words attested in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary (Barber 2004) prior to the birth of the informant (e.g., terrace, attested in 1515), and which would have been acquired with the remainder of the English lexicon.

discourse, among them emblematic or special-purpose uses like word play, cross-language punning, and learned uses. These draw attention to the other language through a variety of discourse strategies like repetition, hesitation, intonational highlighting, and explicit metalinguistic commen- tary. They differ from true borrowing or intra-sentential code-switching, which minimize the salience of the other language by means of smooth transitions, morphosyntactic integration, etc. Emblematic combinations create maximal distance between the two languages, while their true counterparts are integrated seamlessly into the discourse. If code-switching and borrowing were to lead to structural change (an outcome which, contrary to popular opinion, has received no empirical support), only true exemplars would be implicated.
In this context, it is striking that the overwhelming majority of lone French-origin words in the Quebec English Corpus are used metalinguis- tically, as in (31a), in the context of explanation or translation (31b), or for a variety of other special discourse purposes.

Whether they’re English or allophone or bilingual or not bilingual, they often, uh- sometimes use French words. That are just automatic for them. Like de ́panneur. ‘Cause there’s no better word than de ́panneur. It’s true, I mean every anglophone still says de ́panneur. I don’t know anybody who uses any other word. Because there’s no good word to replace it. Some words are just perfect. It’s like, convenience store? Or corner store? Dep is like- it’s only one syllable! (QEC/MTL/170:646)

POPLACK, WALKER and MALCOLMSON 209
b. I call them gar–garderies, these places where the children go now and that, eh? Daycare, like, they call them. (QEC/QC/011:1197)
To illustrate, Figure 7 plots for the 14 high-frequency (operationally defined as having occurred ten times or more) lexical items of French origin in the Quebec English Corpus, the proportion of each which was used unreflectingly (rather than rhetorically, i.e., in special-purpose contexts). Note that only four (cegep ‘Quebec secondary school’, metro ‘subway’, quebecois(e) ‘Quebecer’, and stage ‘work term’), qualify as true loanwords in this sense13; the others are virtually all used with full speaker awareness, for specific discourse functions.
Code-switching, or the alternation of multiword fragments of the two languages, is likewise exceedingly rare, even when compared with rates for other bilingual communities, calculated from data collected using similar methodology (Poplack 1980, 1985). Table 11 shows that a full one-third of the participants did not switch at all, and another 25% switched only once or twice during the course of their interactions.
Moreover, precisely as was observed with the borrowings, nearly half of the 589 code-switches in the corpus occurred in the context of metalinguistic commentary, as in (32), with virtually all of the remainder also used for other special purposes (Poplack 1985; Poplack et al., in preparation), such as to render idiomatic expressions, as in (33).
(32) That‘s why I ‘m happy that we started with French, because with all the grammar, and like, every object has a sex, un cheval, une chaise [‘a [m] horse, a [f] chair’], you know? That’s completely ridiculous! (QEC/QC/064:1057)
(33) Like the French-English rights now, there’s still that ‘‘yes no’’ thing, you know, it’s still there, and like, Vive le Que ́bec or Vive le Canada, and stuff like that. (QEC/QC/068:842)
8. DISCUSSION
In its new and unfamiliar guise of minority or subordinate language, Quebec English has become subject to discourse typical of other minority situations, which characterizes it as threatened and distinctive, purportedly due to convergence with French. In this paper, we have described a research project specifically designed to provide an empirically accountable assessment of the existence and extent of contact-induced change in a situation of intense, long-term contact. Participants in our study describe a sociolinguistic situation which can be characterized as maximally conducive to convergence. They are also in agreement that
13Even here, the first three are arguably proper names.

 Figure 7: Function of ‘‘high frequency’’ borrowing in the Quebec English Corpus
French has in fact influenced Quebec English, particularly as regards the lexicon.
But, once the highly salient French-origin incorporations are placed in the context of the wider discourse, borrowed forms are seen not only to be extremely rare (constituting an average of 7/100 of 1 percent of the total lexicon), but also to be used with full speaker awareness: metalinguistically, rhetorically, and for other special discourse purposes. The even more sporadic multiword switches to French serve exactly the same functions. This is hardly the kind of bilingual language use that can be expected to lead to contact-induced change. The construction of the Quebec English Corpus sets the stage for ongoing studies of other areas of

Joining the Western Region: Sociophonetic Shift in Victoria
Rebecca Roeder1, Sky Onosson2, and Alexandra D’Arcy2
Abstract
The literature on Canadian English provides evidence of distinct dialect regions. Within this landscape, the province of British Columbia is set apart as a sub-region in the west, yet information concerning “local” English is notably skewed toward a single urban setting, Vancouver. To assess and extend the generalizability of prior observations, this paper targets the city of Victoria and situates the results from a large-scale sociolinguistic investigation within the model of the typical (western) Canadian city presented in Boberg (2008, 2010). We consider vocalic features characterized as either General Canadian or distinctively Western Canadian. We also consider “yod” (i.e., the presence of an onglide in student, tune, and the like), a conservative feature that is obsolescing across the nation. Our results support Boberg’s (2008, 2010) observations while positioning Victoria as both innovative— participating in national changes—and conservative—joining certain changes relatively recently and retaining older dialect features. Such results enable us to trace leveling to national and more local dialect patterns, while also reminding us of sociohistorical forces in the formation of dialects.

88 Journal of English Linguistics 46(2) 1. Introduction
The publication of the Atlas of North American English (ANAE; Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006) was a milestone achievement in North American English dialectology, provid- ing a comprehensive overview of white urban vowel patterns and systems in the US and Canada. To this considerable body of evidence, the Phonetics of Canadian English project (PCE; Boberg 2008, 2010) added critical internal geographic detail for Canadian dialect regions. Importantly, where a primary concern of Labov, Ash, and Boberg (2006) with respect to Canada was to situate it within the taxonomy of North American English dialects (Boberg 2008:130), the explicit aim of the PCE was to provide a more elaborated picture of internal variation. As a result, the PCE has laid the groundwork for finer grained regional analyses, raising at least three topics for further exploration.
First, within the broader background of the PCE, areas that were aggregated within larger urban complexes as well as those with histories of isolation (social, geographic) remain relatively unexplored. By broadening the empirical database, sites such as these hold the potential to expand the sociolinguistic and regional validity of Boberg’s (2008, 2010) observations. They can also reveal pathways of change as dialects begin to participate in supralocal patterns of variation, simultaneously shedding light on con- servative and innovative features within a variety.
Second, as second-generation members of their native speech communities, the PCE participants were ideal representatives of local dialects, but the sample was limited to undergraduate students. This restricts the generalizability to some extent, in terms of synchronic, generational patterns of change and social effects on variation.
Third, a number of phonetic features of Canadian English overlap with similar features in the US (see Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006 for discussion). For example, a pattern resembling the Canadian Shift (lowering and retraction of kit, dress, trap) has been observed, alongside merger of the low back vowels (lot, thought, palm), in areas of the Midland and Western United States (e.g., Bigham 2010; Durian 2012; Kennedy & Grama 2012).1 This makes the broader cross-national profile relevant to local descriptions. Political borders are sometimes linguistic boundaries also (e.g., the Northern Cities Shift has not crossed into southern Ontario; see Boberg 2000; Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006), but sometimes they are not (e.g., the diffusion of Foreign (a), trap > lot, into Canadian English from American English; see Boberg 2000, 2009).2
In this study we tackle these evidential points, problematizing space (within a region—British Columbia, and across regions—Canada, the US), diachrony (across apparent time), and social categories (across gender).3 We replicate the analytical methods of the PCE (Boberg 2008, 2010) and present a detailed analysis of five features (and thirteen lexical sets) of English in Victoria, a formerly isolated urban center in southern coastal British Columbia (BC). Our participants range in age from fourteen to ninety-eight years and represent diverse backgrounds. Our results thus fill a descriptive gap in the linguistic geography of North American Englishes, adding momentum to the growing movement toward what Eckert (2016:viii)
 
Roeder et al. 89
 describes as “a detailed Western dialectology.” The sample design enables an ana- lysis of change over time, revealing the ways in which a previously peripheral region becomes aligned (or not) with supraregional changes affecting the broader national variety. This has implications for comparative sociophonetics and regional dialectology, and serves as a reminder of the impacts of sociohistorical factors on the formation of dialects.
2. Victoria as a Sociolinguistic Entity
Victoria is located on a peninsula at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, separated from continental Canada by the Salish Sea. Settler colonialism began in the region with the establishment of a Hudson’s Bay Company trading post in 1843. Incorporation as a city followed in 1862, and when BC joined the Canadian Confederation in 1871, Victoria was named the provincial capital (e.g., Gregson 1970). Importantly, how- ever, no overland routes connect Victoria (or any part of the island) to the mainland. As a result, Victoria was relatively isolated throughout much of its history. Transportation links (land, sea, air) are now regular and plentiful, but for more than a century land travel to elsewhere on the island required an arduous journey through a mountainous pass, and boat service was limited, particularly in the winter. The city was briefly a busy seaport during the BC gold rush (late 1800s), but it quickly lost ground to Vancouver, the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, when the rush waned. Regular, year-round ferry service between the peninsula and the Canadian mainland was only established in 1960, the same period when affordable air travel became available.
The settler population was established by westward migration from southern Ontario; throughout the city’s history these Canadian migrants have consistently been the majority demographic input. At the same time, Victoria has always had a British substrate. From the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries, just over 20 percent of in-migration came from England (D’Arcy 2015:49). It is therefore an important part of the city’s history that, integrated within the realities of colonial life, Victoria’s founders intended to establish a settlement to which “British subjects could safely migrate” and “[establish] their children’s inalienable heritage and an eternal link of sentiment with the Motherland” (Kluckner 1986:11; see also Reksten 1986). The pri- mary means for ensuring this cultural continuity was education, paramount in the transfer of upper-middle-class English norms. Until the end of the Second World War, many teachers and virtually all private school headmistresses were recruited directly from England, as were models of governance, curricula, and pedagogical materials (Barman 1984; Trueman 2009).
Today the most enduring hallmarks of the English are primarily architectural and toponymic.4 The historically English-settled part of town, which remains affluent and independent despite its changing demographics, is known as the Tweed Curtain. It was where the private-school educated upper class was born and raised, and an English- like accent, known locally as “the Van Isle accent,” persevered among the city’s social elite. Features of this social accent include variable rhoticity in post-vocalic contexts,

90 Journal of English Linguistics 46(2)
 variable application of the trap-bath split, and retention of intervocalic [t].5 Speakers with this accent are all elderly now—the opening up of the island, the shift away from English teachers and school administrators, alongside other factors, has impacted its sustainability. What is important for our purposes is that these “English” children re- presented only a small proportion of Victoria’s young. The majority of the population has always lived in front of the Tweed Curtain, not behind it.
Nonetheless, the English substrate and the historically restricted level of contact raise the possibility that Victoria may not align fully with other urban centers that have provided the primary input to descriptions of Canadian English. This seems particu- larly pertinent at a time when the sociophonetics of English in BC are emerging as an area of interest (e.g., Sadlier-Brown & Tamminga 2008; Pappas & Jeffrey 2013; Swan 2016). In both historical and contemporary terms, research on BC has generally relied on evidence from Vancouver, the largest metropolitan area in the province and the third largest in the country (at roughly 2.5 million). Vancouver also belongs to the “super-diversity” category, characterized by population diversification through lin- guistic, ethnic, and country-of-origin channels (see Vertovec 2007). Victoria, by con- trast, is much smaller (metropolitan population 350,000) and much less diverse (D’Arcy 2015:47-48).
Vancouver has either been the specific focus (e.g., Gregg 1957, 1992; Chambers & Hardwick 1986; de Wolf 1988, 1993; Esling 1991; Esling & Warkentyne 1993; Sadlier-Brown & Tamminga 2008) or the primary focus (Hung, Davison & Chambers 1993; Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006; Boberg 2008) of most previous work on English in the region. The rest of BC has figured much less prominently in descriptions of Canadian English. The PCE, for example, included a few speakers from the interior of the province but none from the island (Boberg, personal communication, November 3, 2016). Studies that include Victoria comprise impressionistic analyses of Canadian Raising and Fronting (Hung, Davison & Chambers 1993) and instrumental studies on Canadian Raising and the Canadian Shift (Rosenfelder 2007; Hoffman 2010; Pappas & Jeffrey 2013). Despite these exceptions, the picture of English in BC is notably skewed toward a single urban variety and is limited with respect to social and demo- graphic breadth.
It goes without saying that any region is greater than a single city, and yet models of linguistic diffusion direct us to large conurbations as central vectors of variation and change (Trudgill 1974; Bailey et al. 1993; Labov 2003). In this case, there is reason to expand beyond such concentrated evidence. Within the linguistic ecology of English in BC, what do other locations and socio-cultural settings contribute to the overall picture?
Relying on Boberg (2008, 2010) as points of reference, this study seeks to position Victoria within the Western Canadian dialect region, thereby adding generalizability to previous results. In doing so, we examine change over time, effectively tracing the shift from isolation to integration within a social and geographic milieu. This allows us to ask not only how Victoria fits in but also how it came to fit in. In other words, we can begin to probe questions of leveling as features are shared across vast geographic expanses of the Canadian landscape.

  3. Data and Methods
To explore these questions, we draw on the Synchronic Corpus of Victoria English (SCVE), part of the Victoria English Archive (for details, see D’Arcy 2017). The full archive contains both contemporary and archival materials, representing over 300 hours of dialogue from 220 speakers of primarily British descent. The synchronic portion, the SCVE, consists of sociolinguistic interviews with 162 locals, collected by a team of field workers in 2011-2012. The speakers are first to sixth-generation Victorians—many of whom represent different generations of the same family— from a range of occupational and educational backgrounds. Their years of birth span 1913 to 1998, for an age range of fourteen to ninety-eight years at the time of record- ing. From the full synchronic corpus, a 114-speaker sub-sample was selected for analysis with the aim of balancing speaker sex and age as much as possible within and across cells; see Table 1. Selection was randomized. The eighty-five-year age range is an integral component of our analysis: it expands the window beyond uni- versity students and brings a continuous apparent time component to the question of dialect differentiation (or homogenization) in the Canadian context (cf., Boberg 2008, 2010).
The PCE analysis is based on word-list data. The full list is available in Boberg (2008:153), which the SCVE replicated (the word witch, not discussed here, was added to target the merger of /w/ and /ʍ/ [witch, which]).6 In Table 2 we present the part of the list, broken down by lexical set and, in some cases, phonological context, that is relevant to the analyses we present. While we acknowledge that word-lists are often used to elicit a more formal style in sociolinguistic interview contexts, repli- cating the PCE list has two main advantages. First, the list was custom-designed for Canadian English, with the target vowel consistently in primary stress position and phonological environments controlled for adjacent phonemes. Second, it provides an identical lexical set for comparative analysis with Boberg’s (2008) large-scale results.

 3.1. Analytical Foci: The Features
To capture the characteristics of Victoria speech while also situating the variety in a larger dialect geography, we focus on phonetic variables that document regional or supraregional patterns (Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006; Boberg 2008, 2010). Two fea- tures, the Canadian Shift and back vowel fronting, are described in ANAE as wide- spread in North America (see below); Boberg (2008, 2010) identifies them as General Canadian. These features enable assessment of mainstream influence and of leveling to broader, national patterns. To assess regional characteristics, we investigate start vowel retraction and the proximity of pre-nasal and pre-voiced-velar trap (i.e., ban, bag), features identified by Boberg (2008) as distinctively Western Canadian.7 Finally, to explore the possibility of dialect differentiation, we move beyond the features iso- lated in ANAE and the PCE and consider “yod” (i.e., the presence of an onglide in student, tune, and the like), a conservative feature argued to be obsolescing in North American varieties of English.

  Figure 1. The Canadian Shift (adapted from Roeder & Gardner 2013)
3.1.1.TheCanadianShift. ResearchonNorthAmericanEnglisheshasrevealedacommon pattern of systemic change in a subset of the vowel inventory—the kit, dress, and trap vowels (rows 2, 4, and 5 of Table 2). Generally speaking, these lexical sets are exhibiting lowering and/or retraction in the Western and Midland regions of the US (e.g., Bigham 2010; Durian 2012; Kennedy & Grama 2012; but see Drager et al. 2013 for a different pattern in Hawai’i) and across Canada (e.g., Esling & Warkentyne 1993; Boberg 2005a, 2008, 2010; Hagiwara 2006; Sadlier-Brown & Tamminga 2008; Hoffman 2010; Roeder & Jarmasz 2010; Pappas & Jeffrey 2013; Kettig & Winter 2017). Although the phonetic details are somewhat different and shifts involving the lax front vowels in North American varieties are sometimes referred to by different names (e.g., the California Shift), we consider them to be governed by the same underlying phonology.
Regardless of locale, kit and dress each pattern as unified lexical sets in Canadian English. That is, neither is subject to allophonic splits. trap, on the other hand, is sub- ject to multiple sub-patterns. As shown in Table 2 (rows 5-7), we consider three of them here (see Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006): before a labial or coronal, before a non- velar nasal, and before a voiced velar. It is the pre-labial and pre-coronal contexts that participate in the Canadian Shift; these are the environments we refer to when we discuss trap. The other two contexts relate to a separate phenomenon, raising of ban and bag, discussed below.
Clarke, Elms, and Youssef (1995) first documented the Canadian Shift, which they proposed was triggered by the merger of the low back vowels (palm, lot, thought); this merged set also underwent further retraction (see Figure 1). That these features are linked remains a robust hypothesis, in that many regions with retraction/lowering of the lax front vowels are characterized by the low back merger (Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006). In addition to tracking the Canadian Shift in the SCVE materials then, we also explore the behavior of the low back vowels.
3.1.2. Raising of baN and bag. The raising patterns of ban and bag are diagnostic of regional dialect areas in North America.8 ban commonly raises across varieties,

94 Journal of English Linguistics 46(2)
 varying by degree of shift along F1. bag raising is attested across the north-central and northwestern US (e.g., Zeller 1997; Bauer & Parker 2008; Wassink 2015), as well as from Ontario to Vancouver in Canada (e.g., Boberg 2008, 2010). The Prairies and BC are set apart, however, in that among young people, ban and bag exhibit equivalent degrees of raising (Boberg 2010:207). The more typical pattern is the “continuous” short-a pattern, in which the vowel raises more before nasals than before velars (Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006; Boberg 2010).
3.1.3. Back Vowel Fronting. Back vowel fronting is cross-linguistically common (Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006:155). In North American Englishes, fronting of goose is well attested and is often accompanied by fronting of goat (e.g., Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006; Boberg 2010:230). foot is sometimes implicated as well (e.g., Ward 2003). Boberg (2008:141) found no significant variation between regions in Canada for the F2 of either goose or goat, but he noted that Vancouver speakers were among the most innovative in the PCE (see also Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006:143-145, 150-157). Boberg (2010:209) subsequently reported a split in Western Canada, with goose and goat more fronted in BC than in the Prairies. In short, Vancouver has highly innovative realizations of both goose and goat. In varieties with back vowel fronting, goose and goat tend to be more advanced following coronal onsets (probably for assimilatory reasons), while tokens before /l/ tend to be more conservative. For example, Boberg (2008:137) found goat to be higher and backer in pre-lateral contexts than elsewhere. We thus follow him in differentiating between these two environments (cf., Table 2, rows 12-13).
As outlined in Table 2 (rows 15-19), goose was separated into four sets that reflect phonologically conditioned variation: post-labial and non-pre-lateral (boot), pre-lat- eral (fool), and two post-coronal categories, one with yod historically (new) and one without (too). These sets are motivated by phonetic factors, though the degree of too fronting varies regionally (Labov 2010:263).9
3.1.4. start Retraction. Boberg (2008, 2010) reported the F2 of start to be one of the most regionally distinct features of Canadian English. It is also stable (Boberg 2008:149). In Ontario, the Maritimes, and Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec and the Western region, start is significantly more retracted.
3.1.5.Yod. Variable realization of the on-glide, “yod,” is a well-attested feature of Canadian English (e.g., Avis 1956; Pringle 1985; Gregg 1992, 2004; Clarke 1993, 2006). It occurs in post-coronal position in a historically related subset of goose in which an initial coronal is followed by yod (new), as in new [nju]. This set contrasts with too, in which yod is historically absent, as in too [tu] (cf., Table 2, rows 17-18). Canadian English has retained yod to a greater degree than have US varieties, despite regular indications of a longitudinal shift toward yod-less pronunciations (e.g., Clarke 1993; de Wolf 1993; Boberg 2010). Given the conservative status of yod retention in Canadian English and the local historical context (geographically

Roeder et al. 95
 peripheral and socially insular), yod is a feature of potential heuristic value for determining the degree to which the city’s local variety does or does not reflect broader linguistic norms.
3.2. Exclusions and Target Words
Because liquids have considerable co-articulatory effects on adjacent vowels (e.g., Lehiste 1964; Harrington & Cassidy 1999), we excluded pre-rhotic tokens (except those in the start set) and pre-lateral tokens. The only exceptions were /ul/ and /ol/ words. Foreign borrowings, as determined by Boberg (2010:140), were also set aside because they displayed variable realizations that likely derive from variation in the underlying phonology. This resulted in a final dataset of 9082 tokens, as summarized in Table 2.
3.3. Acoustic Measurement and Normalization Procedures
The word-list files were annotated using Praat (Boersma & Weenink 2015). The Forced Alignment and Vowel Extraction (FAVE) measurement technique (Rosenfelder et al. 2011) was then operationalized for vowel measurement; FAVE output was double-checked for accuracy. To most closely approximate the methodological approach reported in Boberg (2008), we used FAVE’s default measurement method, which measures each vowel at one-third of its duration. Exceptions to this were the front up-gliding face vowel (measured at maximum F1), the back up-gliding goat vowel (measured halfway between the beginning of the segment and maximum F1), and too and new (measured at the beginning of the segment). The PCE measurement point for these vowels was maximum F1 (Boberg, personal communication, October 14, 2016), which could not be replicated with FAVE. As such, the measurement points for fleece, too, and goat differ between studies. These relatively minor methodologi- cal discrepancies are discussed further in the presentation of results. To increase com- parability with the PCE, we adopted the same normalization algorithm used by Boberg (2008), following Nearey (1978). We calculated a natural log from both the group mean (F1/F2 together) and the mean for each speaker’s data. We then calculated a scaling factor for each speaker based on the difference between the two means; this was used to normalize each speaker’s data.10
For yod we adopted an alternate methodology. Despite this feature being relatively well studied, the acoustic characteristics that distinguish retention versus loss (drop- ping) remain fairly obscure, for the simple reason that they are rarely reported. Even in Labov, Ash, and Boberg (2006) the details are sparse; they noted that when yod was elided, a more fronted nucleus (F2) sometimes maintained a distinction between the yod and non-yod sets (2006:54). Labov, Ash, and Boberg (2006:38) measured formant values “at the point where F1 reached its maximal value” and then took F2 at the same point. This suggests that F2 may be a useful criterion for yod identification, but the specific acoustic qualities of dropping versus retention were not explored.

We apply a more comprehensive instrumental approach. In a preliminary percep- tual study, goose tokens from a subset of the SCVE speakers (N = 15) were classified according to audible presence or absence of yod. In this task, carried out indepen- dently by each of the authors, the three-way inter-rater agreement rate was 81 percent (N = 192); non-unanimous tokens were set aside. Discrete measurements of vowel formants were then made at twenty time points across vowel duration. ANOVA testing revealed that the perceptual contrast between yod and non-yod was reflected most consistently in F2 at 25 percent of vowel duration, with a mean difference of 737 Hz. Since the nearest equivalent time point used by FAVE is 20 percent, that point was substituted in subsequent analyses. ANOVA testing also reveals the expected effect of gender related to F2 values on unnormalized data (F = 122.4, p < .001), which follows from physiological sex differences. In the analyses that follow, an acoustic diagnostic was selected for determining yod occurrence, set as the first quartile value of F2 within the perceptually classified set of yod tokens (i.e., including the upper 75 percent of that distribution). This value was determined on a per-gender basis: women, 2258 Hz; men, 1916 Hz. We elaborate on this when we discuss the results.
4. Results
The features that we consider represent a wide range of regional patterns. In what fol- lows, we systematically work through each, examining their synchronic status in Victoria through two main lenses: comparatively, with Boberg (2008, 2010), and tem- porally, across apparent time. To first set the baseline, we can ask how the synchronic reality among younger speakers compares to the national picture presented by the PCE.

Roeder et al. 97
 Figure 2 compares vowel means from young Victorians to Boberg’s (2008) regionally balanced means for the PCE undergraduates, which he provides as “an abstraction deve- loped for purposes of comparative analysis” (2008:135).11 The PCE corpus was com- piled between 1999 and 2005 (Boberg 2010:144), meaning that the youngest speakers were born no later than 1987. Our baseline comparison for the SCVE is speakers born 1989 to 1998. To maximize comparability, the SCVE data in Figure 2 were normalized using the group F1/F2 mean (1119 Hz) and the natural log (7.02) from the PCE.
The overall picture from Figure 2 is one of large-scale parallelism: the PCE and SCVE points generally approximate each other. Nonetheless, differences are evident. trap is higher in the SCVE than in the PCE, a result which may relate to the status of the Canadian Shift in Victoria. lot-thought-palm is also somewhat higher than the PCE mean, as well as slightly backer. Phonetically it is in the [ɔ] range, with a mean F1 close to that of dress, akin to the realization of the merged low back vowel that has been reported in California (e.g., Aiello 2010).
boot/too also presents a point of contrast, which we take as reflective of two fac- tors: the more recent collection date of the SCVE materials and measurement point. This latter observation also affects fleece and goat. Given well-established vowel trajectory patterns, the means would almost surely be closer if taken at the same time point in the acoustic signal, although this remains to be verified definitively. As dis- cussed above, in the SCVE data fleece was measured at one-third of duration, whereas the PCE measurements were taken at maximum F1—the beginning of the trajectory for an up-gliding vowel. This means that in Figure 2, fleece in the SCVE is positioned one-third of the way into the vowel. The fronted position of boot/too in the SCVE relative to the PCE can be similarly explained. In the SCVE, post-coronal tokens were measured at the beginning of the vowel but post-labial ones were mea- sured at one-third of vowel duration, which would be a more fronted position. This would explain the more fronted data point, although as we discuss below, there is considerable variation for this vowel both within and across speakers in the SCVE. goat is more difficult to compare between studies. In the SCVE, goat was measured halfway between the beginning of the segment and maximum F1, whereas it was measured at maximum F1 in the PCE.12 As a result, goat appears higher and fronter in the SCVE because it is midway through the descending trajectory of the vowel as it moves toward the nucleus.
4.1. The Canadian Shift
The PCE data indicate that the Canadian Shift is a cross-Canada development (Boberg 2008:136). To begin to assess its status in Victoria, we first consider kit, dress, and trap in apparent time, as in Figure 3. Means for the oldest speakers, born between 1913 and 1941, are shown with solid black symbols. In order to simplify the figure, only means for the oldest, middle, and youngest cohorts are shown. MANCOVA indicates that the old- est group is significantly differentiated from the other groups for all six parameters mea- sured—F1/F2 of kit, dress, and trap (p < .001; F-ratio range between 13 and 38; partial eta-squared range between .138 and .306).13 Such results suggest that the Canadian Shift has been underway in Victoria since before the middle of the twentieth century.

The observed apparent-time trajectory of dress concurs with the proposal that retrac- tion is a more pronounced direction of change only after significant lowering has occurred (Kettig & Winter 2017). This pattern is also apparent in the results. In general, when a vowel lowers along the outer front edge of the vowel space, some concurrent retraction inevitably occurs as a result of physiological factors (see Figure 7); it is the observed subsequent centralization of kit, dress, and trap that we refer to here. In par- allel with Boberg (2005a), the F2 of dress demonstrates the largest change overall (F = 11.302, p < .001, partial eta squared = .305). trap is the lowest vowel in the acoustic space and, beginning with speakers born in 1942, it appears to have reached its lower limit. From that point forward, the primary vector is retraction.
In fact, for each Canadian Shift vowel the large difference in means across age groups suggests dramatic change among speakers born since the Second World War (WWII). This period is also noted as a turning point in the Canadian Shift by Roeder and Jarmasz (2010) for another Canadian locale, Toronto. However, the rate of change appears to have increased in Victoria with speakers born around 1940 and later; in Toronto it slowed among speakers born in this period, appearing to have been nearing the end of its S-curve, and a similar observation was made for Thunder Bay, in northwestern Ontario (Roeder 2012). In Victoria, robust change has been ongoing across apparent time.
At the same time, gender only emerges as a main effect for F2 of trap, with women born in 1979 and later patterning roughly a generation ahead of men (F = 7.396, p < .001, partial eta squared = .223) (see also Pappas & Jeffrey 2013). MANOVA (which was controlled for phonological environment and takes speaker into account as a random vari- able) indicates the effect to be most distinct among the youngest speakers, born 1994 to 1998. The lack of a main effect of gender is striking, but it is possibly due to considerable variation within the sample, a predictable result of rapid change at the community level.
What emerges from these results is that—assuming that kit, dress, and trap had similar starting points across regions—the Canadian Shift appears to be more recent in

Roeder et al. 99
 Victoria than elsewhere (e.g., Toronto, Thunder Bay, Montreal). This is consistent with Victoria’s more peripheral status historically (geographic and social), but it raises another question. If we accept the hypothesis that the shift was triggered by the merger of the low back vowels (Clarke, Elms & Youssef 1995), when did it entrench in Victoria? In other words, the diachronic status of the Victoria vowel system is directly implicated in patterns of change over time.
When speakers born before 1941 are excluded from the analysis, a MANCOVA of age and gender shows no significant F1/F2 differences between lot, thought or palm. However, when the older speakers are included, the Tukey b post hoc test reveals that the oldest group has a significantly higher thought and more fronted palm than the rest of the community, and linear regression indicates change over apparent time for both the F1 of thought (F = 11.886, p = .001, R2 = .096) and the F2 of palm (F = 9.403, p = .003, R2 = .077). The significant p value despite a low R-squared reflects the fact that, even though age does not correlate with the depen- dent variable for speakers born after 1941 (N = 86), it does correlate significantly for those born before then (N = 28). This strongly suggests that the back vowels were not stable in early twentieth-century Victoria English, with the merger going to comple- tion only with speakers born after 1940.
As for the status of the merger in western Canada more generally during the mid-twen- tieth century, Boberg (2010:128) provides a detailed synopsis of the relevant contemporary observations. He notes that the merger was documented in Vancouver by Gregg (1957:21- 22) and in Saskatchewan by Lehn (1959:93), though data collected in 1949-1950 and reported on in Allen (1976: vol. 3, 39-41, 156-157) brings into question whether the merger was yet fully completed in rural areas of northwestern Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. It may be the case that Victoria patterns similarly to non-urban areas of western Canada in this regard. Given the city’s history, this is not anomalous. Victoria’s isolation was an ideal linguistic preserver across its first one hundred years, allowing a more conservative model to persist through to the WWII period.14 In Victoria, a later onset of this merger would be consistent with the dramatic trajectory of the Canadian Shift over the last eighty-five years.
In sum, the Canadian Shift appears to have had a later onset in Victoria than observed elsewhere, yet younger speakers pattern closely with general Canadian norms as cap- tured by the PCE for these lexical sets (Figure 2). This suggests robust change over apparent time. Considered together, these results intimate that older Victorians are less mainstream (i.e., are more conservative) with respect to the quality of the Canadian Shift vowels, despite the innovative realizations used by younger Victorians.
4.2. Back Vowel Fronting
Another change affecting Canadian English on a national level is back vowel fronting (only the Maritimes and Newfoundland and Labrador appear to resist this trend; Boberg 2008). Since no direct comparison is being made to the PCE data, this portion of the analysis relies on data normalized using the SCVE corpus-internal F1/F2 mean (1072 Hz) and natural log (6.98). As a first approximation of the Victoria system, Figure 4 presents the results for boot, goat, and foot. All are fronting over apparent time, align- ing the variety with the broad trends affecting North American varieties of English (Boberg 2010), but there is no effect of gender for F1 or F2 for any of these sets.

                                                                                                                                                                                                        Figure 4. Fronting of boot, goat, and foot Across Apparent Time in the SCVE
The results in Figure 4 reveal the expected allophonic variation for boot, too, and fool. Linear regression results for boot indicate significant apparent time change along the F2 dimension (fronting); there is no significant change in F1. When consid- ered relative to the retraction of trap in Figure 3, the tendency for the F2 of boot/too and trap to converge over apparent time (as boot fronts and trap backs) is clearly manifest (see Boberg 2008, 2010).
The normalized mean F2 for too of 1905 Hz situates Victoria alongside most of North America as dramatically fronted, although the effect may be exaggerated here because too was measured at the beginning of the segment, where co-articulatory effects of the coronal consonant are strongest. As we discuss below, too has experi- enced rapid change over apparent-time. For goat and foot, linear regression indicates significant change in both F2 (fronting) and F1 (lowering).15 The statistics are pre- sented in Table 3.
Although the F1/F2 means for goat and foot are very close for the youngest speakers, born 1994 to 1998 (ages 14-18), several factors not examined here likely preserve the distinction between these vowels. goat is diphthongal whereas foot is monophthongal. There may also be effects of conditioning environment that distinguish words within the goat set from each other and from words in the foot set. Ward (2003) observed similar movement over apparent time for boot, goat, and foot, but noted a distinction in means for goat in syllable-final and pre-consonantal position.
Following the results in Boberg (2008:150), the fronted positions of boot/too and goat among younger speakers position Victoria with Vancouver as urban and innova- tive. Our observations also implicate foot in fronting of the back vowels over appa- rent time. An additional component of back vowel fronting relates to correlations between the trajectories of these three lexical sets at the level of the individual speaker; linear regression results between each of the parameters undergoing change are presented in Table 4.

  The regression results reveal significant correlations between all of these formant measurements. The correlation between the F2 of goat and the F2 of boot is more robust for women than men such that, particularly in the speech of women, if a speaker displays fronted goat, they are likely to also display fronted boot. For this reason, the correlations are shown separately for men and women. In contrast, aggregate results are presented for foot because the same correlations are statistically significant for both men and women. The results indicate that position of the foot vowel is strongly correlated with both boot and goat, particularly with respect to the F2 dimension for boot and the F1 dimension for goat. Given that each set is changing over apparent time (boot over F2, goat and foot over F1 and F2), the results in Table 4 provide compelling evidence that back-vowel fronting is a systemic process in Victoria. When a speaker is innovative with respect to one of these features, they are likely to be inno- vative with respect to the others. In other words, these vowels are moving in tandem.
4.3. Relative Positions of baN and bag
A diagnostic characteristic of the Western Canadian dialect region concerns the relative positions of ban and bag, where instead of lowering and retracting, the vowel raises and fronts. Following Boberg (2008), we use Cartesian distance on vowel means to assess the relative positions of these sets and compare Victoria to the PCE data in other regions, shown in Figure 5 (to facilitate the comparison, the SCVE data were normalized using the PCE group F1/F2 mean and natural log). In this figure, the distance between ban and trap is measured on the x-axis; that between bag and trap is measured along the y-axis. The dashed black line indicates the median point, at which ban and bag are equidistant from trap—in this case, in the same direction and overlapping in F1/F2 acoustic space.

(Adapted from Boberg 2008:147, Figure 4. BC = British Columbia; PR = Prairies; SO = southern Ontario; TO = greater Toronto; EO = eastern Ontario; QC = Quebec; MT = Maritimes; NL = Newfoundland and Labrador).
Figure 5 indicates that Victoria patterns with BC and the Prairies, set apart from other Canadian areas: ban and bag are raised and fronted to a similar degree and are in relatively equidistant positions along both the x- and y-axes. Notably, these results include data from our full SCVE sample (not only younger speakers, as with the PCE data points). This is because MANCOVA shows that neither ban nor bag has under- gone significant change over apparent time; gender does not correlate with variation either. This suggests that raising of ban and bag, iconic of the Western Canadian dia- lect region, is a stable feature of the local dialect, one that has characterized Victoria English for at least eighty-five years, dating to speakers born as early as 1913.
4.4. Retraction of the start Vowel
The relative position of start is one of the most regionally distinct features of Canadian English (Boberg 2008, 2010), with the vowel significantly more retracted in the West and in Quebec than elsewhere. Figure 6, adapted from Boberg (2008:144), shows the regional F2 means from the PCE; we have added Victoria. This mean includes data from all 114 speakers. As with ban/bag, there is no statistical evidence of either change over time or an effect of gender for either F1 or F2 of start in the SCVE.

Roeder et al. 103
                                                                                                        Figure 6. Mean F2 of start (in Hz) by Region, From West to East
(Adapted from Boberg 2008:144. BC = British Columbia; PR = Prairies; SO = southern Ontario;
TO = greater Toronto; EO = eastern Ontario; QC = Quebec; MT = Maritimes; NL = Newfoundland and Labrador).
That there is no effect of age suggests longitudinal stability of retracted start in Victoria. Moreover, the SCVE mean is very close to those for BC and the Prairies, placing it firmly within the Western dialect region. In other words, for this feature—as with ban/bag—Victoria has consistently patterned with surrounding dialects of Canadian English across the twentieth century.
4.5. Yod
The final feature we consider is yod. Variable yod dropping advanced in English via lexical diffusion, and it remains robustly constrained by lexical item (Avis 1956; Phillips 1981). We focus on retention, as it is the traditional realization. In the SCVE, using the acoustic diagnostics outlined above, yod is retained 39.5 percent overall (N = 440). Compared to both self-report and production data, all of which come from older datasets, this rate of maintenance is striking, diverging from the lower rates of retention that are typically reported in the literature (cf., Clarke 1993, 2006; Gregg 2004). When considered by individual lexical item, the rates vary across a wide range: 22.3 percent (due; N = 112), 37.2 percent (tube; N = 113), 47.7 percent (new; N = 111), 51.0 percent (student; N = 104). Crucially, none is particularly low.
Although yod retention is considered prestigious in Canadian English (e.g., Clarke 2006), leading us to predict a main effect of gender, a Pearson’s chi-square test indi- cated no significance for this predictor (χ2 = 0.00085773, df = 1, p = .9766). Likewise, age, which functions as diagnostic of historical stages, reveals no significant differ- ences across apparent time (χ2 = 1.8106, df = 4, p = .7705). Indeed, the age pattern for each word in the new set is indicative of stability: the medians and interquartile ranges are remarkably consistent across cohorts (though there is variability with respect to the internal rate distributions).

104 Journal of English Linguistics 46(2)
 This result runs in opposition to research on yod in Canadian English to date, which has consistently reported ongoing loss. If yod is relatively stable in Victoria (though also apparently characterized by large community-internal variation), then this—in addition to the high overall rate of retention—would suggest that local English remains relatively conservative with respect to this feature. However, it is possible that what looks like retention of yod overlaps acoustically with a bona fide ongoing change in Canadian English: the fronting of too (see also Sóskuthy et al. 2015).
Among coronal tokens that did not contain yod historically (i.e., the too set), fron- ting is evident in increasing F2 values over apparent time. Separate linear regression analyses on speaker means for unnormalized post-coronal too indicate significant change for both men (F = 24.6, p < .001, R2 = .317) and women (F = 30.56, p < .0001, R2 = .338). In fact, too is fronting even more aggressively than non-post-coronal boot in Victoria speech: F2 has increased steadily from a mean of 1834 Hz among the oldest speakers (71 to 98; years of birth 1913–1942), to 2030 Hz for the youngest ones (14 to 19; years of birth 1994–1998), a total increase of 196 Hz. For new, the comparison values are 2005 Hz and 2039 Hz respectively. Additionally, F2 values for the too set have steadily encroached on those of new; within the youngest age group, they are virtually indistinguishable. This creates an acoustic overlap in F2 space, one that can- not be disambiguated from genuine retention of yod in post-coronal contexts using the methods we have operationalized here. This ambiguity may extend to the realm of audition as well. During the initial classification phase, 11 percent of tokens we unani- mously classified as containing an audible yod were too words, and thus contained not yod but only a highly fronted [u] (the majority of such tokens were produced by speak- ers in the youngest age bracket). As such, while it appears that Victoria has maintained a conservative feature of Canadian English, one that is historically associated with Anglo-Canadian identity (Pringle 1985; Clarke 1993, 2006), the confound of boot/too fronting means that this interpretation must be treated cautiously.
5. Putting the Pieces Together
Phonological simplification is common to areas that have experienced extensive dia- lect mixture and rapid population growth (Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006:214). It is pos- sible that the Canadian Shift and back vowel fronting, both of which may have been triggered by phonological merger (a process of simplification), were established dur- ing periods of such demographic change in the North American dialects where they appear. If we accept this premise, then it is unsurprising that similar trajectories are observed for the kit, dress, and trap vowels, as well as for boot, goat, and foot in both Canada and the American West. A number of studies have reported parallel back vowel fronting in the speech of young people in California (e.g., Hall-Lew 2009; Kennedy & Grama 2012) and Oregon (e.g., Ward 2003; Becker et al. 2016). In nor- thern California, boot, goat, and foot fronting constitute part of a well-documented series of changes referred to as the California Shift that also includes the Canadian Shift-like movement of kit, dress, and trap (e.g., Kennedy & Grama 2012). Figure 7 pulls together Figures 2 and 4, illustrating a similar pattern in Victoria.

Roeder et al. 105
  Figure 7. Centralization of kit, dress, trap, boot, goat, and foot in the SCVE
In Figure 7, means for the youngest SCVE speakers for the vowels under examina- tion here are connected with dashed lines. It is clear that across apparent time, speakers are increasingly using the middle of the acoustic speech range for these vowels, crea- ting a configuration similar to that from the Canadian PCE results (cf., Figure 2).16 In other words, there is a widespread pattern that includes both the Canadian Shift and back vowel fronting. Roeder and Gardner (2013) propose that, as a consequence of the low back merger, trap became underspecified for backness, which facilitated its pho- netic centralization and moved the system toward a triangular configuration that includes one low point vowel (see also Roeder & Jarmasz 2010; Boberg 2010, 2011). Such simplification of the inventory is consistent with hypotheses concerning exten- sive mobility and dialect mixing that characterized Canada and the US West through- out the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries (cf., Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006).
The centralizing tendencies observed for front kit and dress and back goat and foot, on the other hand, may be purely phonetic. Roeder and Gardner (2013) propose that the lowering and retraction of kit and dress was driven by phonetic analogy with trap (cf., Durian 2012) and by dispersion away from the outer front envelope of the vowel space. Similarly, fronting and lowering of foot and goat may reflect phonetic analogy with boot. Labov (2010:148), for example, states that “fronting of /ow/ is independent of any chain shifts, being essentially a parallel response to the fronting of /uw/.” With few exceptions (e.g., eastern New England, parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and northern Illinois), too fronting is ubiquitous in North American Englishes (Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006:154). Labov (2010:107) argues that the merger of too and new (as a consequence of yod dropping) has resulted in a fronted category that acts as a trigger for the fronting of boot. This hypothesis is compatible with the findings from Victoria, which indicate more extensive fronting of too over apparent time than boot in other environments. The result is that the range covered by the allophonic distribution of /uw/ covers most of the top of the vowel space (cf., Figure 7), a common pattern (Labov 2010:109). In this sense, the SCVE results align not only with broad sociophonetic processes in North American dialects but also with their phonological underpinnings.

Walsh (1924:110) wrote that “plain, unpretentious Canadian is a lost language in Victoria.” If this was ever a reality outside the Tweed Curtain, it is certainly untrue in the city’s contemporary sociolinguistic ecology. The comparative sociophonetic evi- dence reveals a sound system that largely mirrors the innovative national patterns reported by Boberg (2008, 2010). This provides corroboration for Boberg’s observa- tions and enriches ecological descriptions of (southern coastal) BC English and Western Canadian English. At the same time, the SCVE results reflect the region’s history. While the matched word-list data aligns younger Victorians with their Canadian peers, the apparent-time trajectory is characterized by rapid leveling to supralocal norms among speakers born in the decades after 1940 (Canadian Shift, back vowel fronting) alongside longitudinal stability of definitional Western Canadian fea- tures (ban/bag raising, start retraction) and maintenance of conservative features (retention of yod). The former exposes Victoria’s alignment with large-scale shifts affecting North American Englishes; the latter provides important insights to earlier stages of (Western) Canadian dialects.
These observations have implications for comparative sociophonetics and regional dialectology. Maintenance of yod imbues local speech with a hint of the conservative and reflects a small yet tenacious aspect of the city’s roots. The longitudinal persistence of start retraction and ban/bag raising, on the other hand, lead us to believe that these features were entrenched across the twentieth century. Considered in tandem with Victoria’s historically (geographic and social, if not political) peripheral status, this sug- gests that these features are rooted in BC and the Prairies more generally, reflecting diachronic isoglosses that may have long demarcated the Western dialect region. In contrast, the merger of lot-thought-palm may have occurred more recently in Victoria than elsewhere in Canada. If this is the case, then this would explain the observation that the Canadian Shift also appears to have had a later onset in the city (assuming the two are linked; Clarke, Elms & Youssef 1995). Chambers (2008) hypothesized that the merger of the low back vowels can be traced to the turn of the nineteenth century in Canadian English (see also Dollinger 2010). Although this predates extensive westward migration, the SCVE results suggest that the low back merger was not inherited whole- scale from westward migration in Victoria; rather, it is a product of mid-twentieth- century change. If such is the case, then it problematizes widely held assumptions regarding a single input source as the foundation of Canadian English (e.g., Bloomfield 1975; Chambers 2004; see also Denis & D’Arcy forthcoming).
When considered in the context of the city’s history, the bulk of our results sug- gest that Victoria has adopted ongoing changes in Canadian English via diffusion, perhaps from Vancouver. The evidence from the Canadian Shift and back vowel fronting indicates that young Victorians pattern closely with their peers across Canada, though change has been relatively recent and has progressed quickly. Specifically, once much of the isolation that formerly marked the region was less- ened, leveling to supraregional patterns advanced at an accelerated rate, enabling the variety to effectively “catch up” to the urban centers captured in the PCE (Boberg
 
Roeder et al. 107
 2008, 2010). This is not surprising (contact is a critical vector for linguistic change), but it is striking to see how rapidly change can progress, given the right circumstances.
At the same time, British Columbia is a large province. Vancouver and Victoria are both coastal, southern, and urban. We leave it to future research to explore the possibi- lity of other boundaries within the province, and to test further the generalizability of Boberg’s (2008, 2010) classification of the province as a reified dialect region.

Notes
1. Except in cases where he does not distinguish between allophonic contexts (e.g., new, too), we use the standard lexical sets provided in Wells (1982) to refer to vowel phonemes.
2. We limit the discussion here to features of accent, yet multiple examples from the lexicon
also exist (e.g., Chambers 1995; Boberg 2005b; Dollinger 2012).
3. Although education has historical significance in Victoria (e.g., Barman 1984; Trueman
2009), it regularly failed to exert a significant effect on variation in our dataset and so we
do not report on it here.
4. Other traces include High Tea at the Empress Hotel, a popular tourist activity, and the play-
ing of “Rule, Britannia” when the local hockey team scores a goal.
5. This description is based on contemporary recordings of locals held by the third author. The following excerpt, from an oral history in the Victoria English Archive (held by agreement with the University of Victoria Archives: Cecilia Bullen, b.1889), highlights the saliency of this accent: “After a bit she said to me ‘What part of England do you come from?’ And I
 
108 Journal of English Linguistics 46(2)
 said ‘But I don’t. I was born here in Victoria.’ ‘Oh’ she said ‘I would never have believed it from your ultra English accent.’ I said ‘I don’t think there’s anything remarkable about my accent. I’m born here. I speak just as my parents taught me to speak.’ I hadn’t been born somewhere else. I said ‘No I’m very proud of being a native of Victoria.’”
6. The word-list was automatically randomized at every presentation. The format was uncom- pressed .wav files, recorded at a sampling rate of 44.1 Hz and a depth of 16 bits.
7. Boberg (2008, 2010) divided Canada into six dialect regions: the West (itself divided into two sub-regions: British Columbia and the Prairies—Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba), Ontario, Quebec, the Maritimes (i.e., New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island), and Newfoundland and Labrador.
8. We excluded sanity, part of the ban set, from the analysis. It did not pattern with other words in this lexical set, alternating between monophthongal and diphthongal realizations.
9. We excluded tool from the goose set. It had an average F2 of 1448 Hz, midway between the post-coronal and pre-lateral averages, meaning that it did not pattern unambiguously with
one set or the other.
10. The dataset used for normalization included the price, mouth, and choice diphthongs (not
included in the current analysis), pre-rhotic force, near, north, nurse, and square, and
pre-lateral goat. This resulted in 13,513 normalized tokens.
11. Boberg (2008) does not provide a comprehensive set of vowel means for the PCE speakers
from BC (eight women, four men).
12. This measurement point is a consequence of the default settings in FAVE extract. The dif-
ferences in measurement points between studies for fleece, goose, and goat only affect the comparison with Boberg’s (2008) PCE data for young speakers and do not compromise the analysis of change over apparent time for this vowel in Victoria speech.
13. To ensure comparable variance of the dependent variable across groups, both Levene’s test of equality of covariance and Box’s test of equality of covariance matrices were used in all MANOVA and MANCOVA calculations presented here.
14. That WWII marks an important transition period in Victoria is likely the result of multiple fac- tors. First, as outlined in Tagliamonte, D’Arcy, and Louro (2016), the end of the war heralded a new period of expanded international relations, affecting business, travel, and education. This era was quickly followed by major technological advances, including the introduction of the jet engine. These new realities would have directly impacted Victoria’s social and geographic isolation, creating tighter transportation and social networks with the mainland at a time when speakers born during and immediately after the war were entering their teens.
15. As with the fool sub-set of goose, goat exhibits a strong tendency to retract in the pre-lat- eral environment. As raised in the methods section, these tokens were analyzed separately; MANCOVA showed no change over apparent time.
16. age does not correlate with fleece or lot/thought/palm; for these sets only the full SCVE means are shown.

"So cool, right?":
Canadian English Entering the 21st Century
SALI A. TAGLIAMONTE
University of Toronto
According to Chambers, "Canadian English has experienced a period of fairly intensive change in the last 60 or 70 years" (2004a:364). In this paper I take up Chambers' observation by exploring how some morpho-syntactic and discourse-pragmatic changes have been progressing in Canada. In so doing I bring into the discussion findings from a new research project which focuses on linguistic innovation and change across current generations of speakers in the Canadian context (Tagliamonte 2003-2006).
1. THE 20TH CENTURY
As a backdrop for the investigation of ongoing linguistic developments, it is important to contextualize the historical and cultural contexts in which the changes have been taking place. Consider the events and developments that have typified the 20th century in North America, and elsewhere. There have been two world wars. The United States has risen as a world power. Public broadcasting has developed, including talking movies in the 1920s and, after 1950, television. There have been massive, widespread technological developments, including the World Wide Web in the 1990s. English has become a global language (Crystal 2003).
These developments have innumerable implications for language change, and for the English language in particular. Class structure,

a vital concomitant of language variation and change (Chambers 2003a), has flattened and literacy has risen (Chambers 2003b:100-101), rural dialects have declined and urbanization has increased. There have been unprecedented changes in communication and media, and popular youth culture has developed. Many of these changes converge in grandstanding the very youngest sectors of the speech community. Indeed, teenagers did not even exist before the 20th century, let alone tweens (the eight- to 12-year-olds) who are now becoming a major advertising market. Moreover, this focus is strengthening with pervasive geographic, social, and occupational mobility, as well as with the increasing tendency towards new types of communication—in the form of text messaging, email, instant messaging, and so on—that are fundamentally changing the types of contacts young people have on a daily basis. As we shall see, all these socio-cultural changes may have added to the influence of youth as drivers of current linguistic change.
To put these external facts in context with the data, Table 1 shows four key groups of current speakers of Canadian English and how their
1
ages link up with the well-known generations of the 20th century.
The people who are over 70 today are the speakers born in the first three decades of the 20th century, many of whom were adolescents during the Second World War. Their children (the baby boomers) are the people whose children (and sometimes grandchildren) are often the teenagers whose language is epitomized in (la-b). The italicized forms are frequently occurring features that are often noted in this younger generation. One of the long-term goals of the project is to understand how Canadian English has become like this. I return to consider some of these features in more
detail below.

The scariest thing that happened was when me and mom went on the Matterhorn, and I got so sick and the ride was going so fast around in circles and I was so nauseous. And I was like "Mommy!" And then Mommy's like "I'm here! I'm here!" But like, she's getting nauseous too right. So it's not really like, anything you can do. It's not like you can be like "Stop the ride!" But like, it was so scary. [C. Felipe, 16, Female]
Yeah, like, my dad watches the Simpsons, right. And they used to be really bad. Because when I was younger, he used to watch it at night. 'Cause it was on. He'd laugh. But my mom would always come in, like, "Don't watch that horrible show," right. Or whatever. And so I was like, "Hm, what's this show?" So I'd watch it, right. [A. Silvaggio, 16, Male]
'According to, for example, Howe and Strauss (1991), a generational view of historical eras is critical for understanding how society changes. This in turn, I speculate, shapes language change as well.

Table 2: Speaker distribution in Toronto English Corpus
The Toronto English Corpus comes from sociolinguistic interviews between one and three hours long. All were collected using a combination of quota-based random sampling and social networking (Tagliamonte 2003-2006). As a fundamental sampling criterion, all the participants had to have been born and raised in Toronto. Similar data collection techniques and sample design were employed for a large-scale study of contemporary British English (Tagliamonte 1996-1998, 1999-2001). In what follows, I compare the Canadian and British data to give the findings a broader context. While these data are technically "Toronto English", there is reason to believe that they may be taken to represent Canadian English more generally, at least if our view is middle-class urban speech (Chambers 2003a:70-71).
The data are divided by age and sex. The speakers range in age from those who were born in the early 1900s to adolescents who were born in the 1980s and 1990s. In total, the corpus comprises 165 speakers, as shown in Table 2.

In conducting analyses of these materials, I use as a foundation the sociolinguistic construct of apparent time (Chambers 2003a:212-213), which is a surrogate for the real-time examination of data at different points in history. Subjects of different ages are interviewed at the same time, and differences in their behaviour are inferred to be temporal analogues. When social and stylistic factors are held constant, linguistic differences among generations of a population will mirror actual diachronic development in the language. Add this to the fact that Canadian English only became "a unified, focused dialect" in the early 20th century (Chambers 1995a:5, 2004b). This means that the oldest speakers in the Toronto English Corpus are among the first generations of native speakers of Canadian English.
I also explore the notion of age grading (Chambers 2003a:165, 206-211), which is defined as a regular, maturational change repeated in successive generations. Crucially, such changes correlate with a particular time of life.
Using the apparent-time construct and this corpus of Torontonians
2
aged nine to 92, my goal is to explore the linguistic character and
underlying mechanisms guiding linguistic change in Canadian English over the 20th and into the 21st centuries. In this paper, I discuss some preliminary distributional findings, abstracting away from the details of the full analyses currently under way.
I begin with several well-known grammatical changes that have been progressing over the past century or so in English. Then, I turn to a feature that is rapidly innovating in the youngest sectors of the contemporary population—adverbs of intensification. Finally, I consider a discourse-pragmatic feature—sentence tags, an area of grammar which contains one of Canada's most well-known shibboleths, eh. Consistent with Chambers' research, I show that there are a plethora of changes going on in Canadian English and many of them have accelerated in the last half of the 20th century.
3. THE LINGUISTIC STUDIES
I report on the distribution findings of three morpho-syntactic features that are the locus of grammatical change in English: future temporal reference (section 3.1), deontic modality (section 3.2), and possessive have (section 3.3).

  T AGLIAMONTE 313
3.1. Future temporal reference
A good example of ongoing grammatical change in English is in the future temporal reference system (Bybee and Pagliuca 1987), where variation

too. (TOR/I/1)
b. If it's gonna be that much of an inconvenience, 17/ just do it myself.

(TOR/N//)
d. I'm afraid that she's going to get annoyed of me. Eventually she will but
yeah it's great. (TOR/3/F)
Although will and shall once shared the future temporal reference system in English, the construction going to has long been encroaching on their functions. It was attested as a future marker in the late 1400s and has been gaining ground ever since (Poplack and Tagliamonte 1999;
5
Tagliamonte 2002). Figure 1 reveals this development in apparent time
in Canadian English. Shall is virtually non-existent, while will and going to compete quite vigorously. Observe the trajectory of change in apparent time. Going to is gradually rising in frequency.
Figure 2 compares going to in apparent time in British and Canadian English (Tagliamonte 2002). The two sets of results are parallel, with Canadian English well ahead in the frequency of going to.
3.2. Deontic modality
The modal auxiliary system of English is undergoing extensive reorganization (Bolinger 1980). One key change is in deontic modality, which involves the expression of obligation or necessity. In this

There is no consensus on whether variable instantiations of future temporal reference are interchangeable or reflect differences in meaning (see discussion in Poplack and Tagliamonte 1999:321). Here, I include all contexts that are (1) clearly temporal, and (2) make reference to future time for the purpose of studying the ongoing grammaticalization of going to into the future temporal reference system of English.

system, must and have to are the older competitors. Another variant, have got to, came into the language much later in the 19th century and got to (with no have) even later. Both have got to and got to are considered colloquial.
Canadian English exhibits considerable variation of forms for this function, as in (5).

  T AGLIAMONTE 315 (5) Variation in the deontic modality system:
a. Because like, now in all high schools, by law you must have a security guard (TOR/2/p)
b. I must admit I think I was a little bit of a city snob. And I gotta say, that's pretty lucky.
I have to tell you, they smile, say "Hello" (TOR/N/s)
c. So it's pretty understood on both sides what one must do to get the other's attention you-know. (TOR/3/D)
d. She would be like "No no no, we've got to keep going, we have to make it to the next level." (TOR/2/i)
e. I said "You have to come up." I said "You must come up." And um the person on the phone, I said "I've gotta go." (TOR/N/s)
Early corpus-based research in British English suggested that have got to and got
to were taking over in contemporary British English (Krug 1998, 2000).
However, recent research on 20th-century plays (drama) has shown that
American English is moving steadily towards more have to. Simultaneously, the
older form must is fading away both in British and American English
(Jankowski 2004). Figure 3 reveals these trajectories in apparent time in
Canadian English (D'Arcy 2005b). Must is rare. However, have got to and got to
are not very frequent either, suggesting that they might never have been viable
forms in Canadian English. Such a hypothesis concurs with recent findings
on a small corpus of pre-Confederation Canadian English (Dollinger, this 6
volume). Instead, use of have to starts out quite high among the oldest speakers (60%) and is approaching categoricity among the youngest speakers (90%). Once again, notice the gradual step-wise cline of this change.
This is quite antithetic to the trajectory in British English (Tagliamonte 2004), where little change in apparent time for have to is visible, as in Figure 4. In British English, the frequency of have to is represented by a relatively flat line hovering at a rate of 40% for all age groups, which means that have to and have got to are in vibrant competition for this grammatical space. An additional comparison is available with Jankowski's (2004) study of American English drama, the results of which show that in the early decades of the 20th century have to represented only about 20% of all deontic contexts. In contrast, Toronto speakers from this time period are considerably ahead; they use have to three times as much, 60% of the time. Canadian English is well ahead in the frequency of a rising form.
6
The fact that these data are written makes this hypothesis even more plausible.
Note however that Dollinger's methodology includes deontic and epistemic must together in contrast to deontic have got to and got to, making direct comparison with his data problematic.

Yet another area of English grammar that has been undergoing change is the form used for stative, possessive meaning. In this system, have is also the older variant; it began to be supplanted by have got early in the 16th century.
Here, too, Canadian English exhibits considerable variation, as in (6). (6) Variation in the stative, possessive system:
a. It has a huge diving platform, diving tower and an Olympic size pool and we've got hundreds of thousands of people going into that pool. (TOR/N/fi)
b. So you have a mixture of you-know, highly educated people, you got a lot of actors and professors, right? (TOR/N/«)
c. We haven't got a- we haven't- Dirk and I don't have a D-V-D player. (TOR/N/Q)
d. Denise doesn't have organizational skills, and then John D'Angelo has like, no social skills. (TOR/2/a)
Somewhat comparable to the have/got layers in deontic modality, the historical trajectory of this system documents gradual replacement of have with have got. In this system the got variants were also quite stigmatized in the past and the use of got alone is considered particularly vulgar as well as "American" (Rice 1932). The Canadian English trajectory is shown in Figure 5. Observe that have got is a very minor variant in this system and got alone is even more infrequent. Have is

predominant, even among the oldest speakers, and in the younger generations it is virtually the only form used. Further, when we compare Canadian English with British English, as in Figure 6, the divergence of the two varieties is dramatic.
The British speakers are using less and less have, but the Canadians are rarely using anything but have anymore. When the Canadian data are compared with American drama (Jankowski 2005), we find that possessive have in American English hovers at only 40% for most of the first half of the 20th century. In contrast, the use of have among the oldest speakers in Canadian English is much higher, at 70%. Again, Canadian English is the variety in the lead, ahead of the American English.
4. WHAT KIND OF CHANGE?
Canadian English exhibits robust trajectories of ongoing grammatical change in its morpho-syntactic features (section 4.1) and in its discourse-pragmatic features (section 4.2).
4.1. Morpho-syntactic features
The distributional findings from the three morpho-syntactic features uncover a number of trends. Canadian English appears to be following

a similar trajectory to British English towards ongoing, incrementally increasing, use of going to to encode future temporal reference. However, for both deontic modality and stative possessive meanings, Canadians are doing something quite different. First, they have opted for the older form in the system—have—making them comparable to the oldest generation in the most remote areas of Britain (Tagliamonte and Smith 2006). Second, Canadian English avoids stigmatized have got to/have got as well as have got/got. Both these facts suggest Canadian conservatism. Yet the rate of change, as well as the trajectory toward categorical representation of these systems with a single form (i.e., have to/have), is dramatic and unique in contrast to British English. Further, Canadian English distinguishes itself from American English in that the rate of use of forms is much higher,
7
suggesting that it is more advanced or perhaps following its own path. Despite these rich trajectories of ongoing grammatical change in the morpho-syntax of Canadian English, to my knowledge this is one of the
8
first times they have been reported. Previous accounts of linguistic
innovation involve renewal of lexis, replacement of verb forms (Chambers 1993, 1995b, 1997, 2002) and phonological developments (Boberg 2004a, 2004b). To this I can now add grammatical change.
4.2. Discourse-pragmatic features
What of the striking discourse-pragmatic features peppered through the examples noted above? In fact, innumerable discourse-pragmatic features are also reported to be on the rise in Canadian English. Forms such as like, be like, whatever, so, stuff, etc. are said to be rampant, particularly among the younger generations. What type of change is involved with these high-profile features? Are they the results of a regular process of linguistic change or are they simply the product of adolescent hyperbole?
Recent research confirms a diagnosis of generational change for at least some of these features. The quotative be like, as shown in (7), is a case in point. In 1995 in Canadian English, quotative be like represented 13% of all quotatives among people in their early 20s (children born in the mid-1970s) (Tagliamonte and Hudson 1999). Yet, by 2001 (among children born in the early 1980s) it has risen to over 60%
7
The relatively advanced frequency of features in the Canadian English data
compared with the American data may be the result of the fact that the Canadian corpus comes from spoken data, but the American materials are, for the most part, written. This question must remain unanswered until comparable data on American English becomes available.

(Tagliamonte and D'Arcy 2004). Together, this evidence suggests that be like has increased by more than four and a half times in the last seven years!
(7) Quotative be like:
We're like, "How was it?"
And they're like, "Oh, it was different."
We're like, " 'Good' different?"
They're like, "You'll see, you'll see." (TOR/N/3)
Additional evidence from real time corroborates the diagnosis of ongoing change rather than age grading. A replication of Tagliamonte and Hudson's (1999) research in Ottawa in 2004 (Shana Poplack, personal communication) reveals that the young adult population between the ages of 25 and 34 (who would have been 17-19 in 1995) do not have the low rate of be like reported by Tagliamonte and Hudson: compare 13% in 1995 to 38% in 2004. This substantially heightened use of be like is comparable to the use by the same age group in Toronto in 2003-2004 (Tagliamonte and D'Arcy, to appear).
Similarly, use of like as a discourse marker is also rising in frequency. This change, too, is regular and incremental across generations of speakers, revealing a remarkable step-wise change in progress (D'Arcy 2005a).
Thus, the fact that the forms noted above are associated with adolescents may not be the result of age-grading, as is often suggested. Rather, the adolescent spike in the frequency of these features may be part of the logistic incrementation of ongoing change (Labov 2001:260, 454-455).
Further evidence may come from analyses of some of the other features, many of which have not yet been investigated in the Canadian context.
4.2.1. Intensifiers
The intensifier system is a key area of grammar for the study of longitudinal recycling (Quirk et al. 1985:590; Peters 1994:269) and one which is also associated with young people (Ito and Tagliamonte 2003:257). Intensifiers are adverbs that boost or maximize meaning, as in (8).
(8) Intensifiers:
a. If he's really dull, but he's like, so hot... (TOR/2/a)
b. It was very pretty ... I loved her hair, it was amazing... And it was really pretty. (TOR/2/m)

  321
Very and pretty evolved as intensifiers in the 16th century. Really, as in (8 a, b, d), was a newcomer in the 18th century, during which time very and really co-existed as popular intensifiers. More recently, however, all indications are that really has risen to become the favoured intensifier, both in American (Labov 1985) and British English (Stenstrom 1999). Consider a distributional analysis of these key forms in apparent time in Canadian English, as in Figure 7. There is startling evidence of change. Very is quickly moving out of favour in Canadian English. On the other hand, use of really is rising and so is beginning to rise, too. Furthermore, notice the asymmetrical acceleration of linguistic change across age groups. Indeed, the difference between the speakers 60+ years old and the speakers 50-59 years old is substantial. However, the leap in frequency of really between the baby boomers and generation X (the 40-49-year-olds compared to the 30-39-year-olds) is even more sensational, and that between the 30-39-year-olds and the 24-29-year-olds is the steepest of all. These developments are particularly interesting because they differentiate generations of speakers

so markedly. Furthermore, this same pattern of acceleration is mirrored for the trajectory of so, confirming that this change is accelerating in this particular age group as well. A comparison of Canadian and British English is shown in Figure 8. The decline of very is happening in both Canada and Britain.
Next consider really and so, as in Figure 9. Really is increasing rapidly from the middle-aged group to the younger speakers in both Canadian and British English. The same pattern is visible for so, but is more gradual here. Note how similar the trajectories of advancement of these latter two intensifiers are across these two major varieties of English. Whatever is leading this change appears to be happening in both locales simultaneously. However, it happened sooner and faster in Canada.
4.2.2. Sentence Tags
I now turn to another discourse-pragmatic feature—sentence tags. While the quintessential Canadian tag eh, as in (9), has received tremendous attention (Avis 1972; Johnson 1976; Gibson 1977; Schecter 1979; Gold 2005; Gold and Tremblay, this volume), little is known about the broader system in which it is embedded.

The forms that often end sentences have been variously referred to as utterance final tags (Aijmer 1985); clause terminal tags (Dines 1980); and extension particles (Dubois 1992). According to Dubois (1992), frequent use of such tags strongly differentiates generations of speakers. If so, this feature may provide another good litmus test for tapping into ongoing linguistic change in Canada.
Although eh has become an icon of Canadian English, there are actually dozens of other ways Canadians end their sentences, as in (10).

In Figure 10, some forms such as and stuff, are indeed highly correlated with younger people. On the other hand, the oldest generation stands out as being the you know generation. Notice too that one of the

most frequent utterance final tags, or something, is actually quite stable across age groups.
In Figure 11, consider first the Canadian shibboleth eh. Even though Canadian young people report that they use this form in everyday interactions (Gold and Tremblay, this volume), the young people in this conversational data do not use it. Instead, it is more of an older person's feature. By far the favourite sentence tag for every age group except the oldest is right. There are also two newer tags on the rise: whatever and so.
In sum, sentence tags are not simply a young people's feature. Nor can it be said that they are all changing, or all changing in the same way. Yet, when change does happen, it accelerates between the baby boomers and generation X. This characteristic watershed of innovation has repeated itself several times in this discussion; I will return to this observation directly.
5. CONCLUSION
In putting the findings from all these feature in perspective, I return to Chambers' observation that Canadian English "has experienced a period of fairly intensive change in the last 60 or 70 years" (2004a:364). Indeed, I can now add that this notable evolution is paralleled in morpho- syntax and discourse pragmatics as well. Moreover, it appears that the young people are taking these changes and pushing them forward even

quicker than the generations before them and changing the way Canadian English is spoken.
Of course, it remains to establish the underlying mechanisms that are guiding these changes, both from an intra-variety and a cross-variety perspective (Labov 1994, 2001). In other words, in this preliminary review of an array of features, I have simply presented distributional analyses of form frequencies across key generation groupings in the Toronto speech community. In upcoming research I will consider additional social and linguistic factors, paying particular attention to their interaction at the community level, and especially the grammar-internal factors that constrain their use. These multi-dimensional influences on the linguistic features will be assessed for their statistical significance, constraint ranking, and relative strength (Tagliamonte 2002), all part of ongoing efforts to understand linguistic variation and change more generally. It also remains to determine how the development of the features I have considered here will play out in the Toronto scene and indeed whether age-grading, communal, or community change, or some combination thereof are implicated. A number of analyses to this end are underway (Tagliamonte and D'Arcy, to appear).
6. DISCUSSION
What are the broad trends that emerge from these findings? Table 3 provides a summary. Some features are declining, including future will, deontic have got to, possessive have got, the intensifier very, and the sentence tag you know. On the other hand, some features are on the rise, including future going to, deontic have to, possessive have, intensifiers really and so, and tags such as whatever, so, and and stuff. However, it is the different trajectories of change, their different rates across varieties, and the specific points in time when they picked up speed that are particularly thought-provoking, as summarized in Table 4.
First, older, formal features of English like shall and must are not really part of the contemporary Canadian English repertoire, and may not ever have been a vital part of the vernacular. Instead there is often robust competition between layered variants—will and going to; have to and have got to; really, very, and so; and in one case a feature that has nearly reached completion, possessive have. These changes can be traced back hundreds of years in the history of English and so are not particular to Canadian English, but are consistent with research on other English corpora (Krug 2000; Mair et al. 2002; Stenstrom 2000). However, some of these changes appear to be progressing in a unique way in Canada— sometimes antithetic to British developments and in some cases much more

advanced than in the United States (as with deontic and possessive have). Ongoing research will explore the reasons for these differences.
Second, as Chambers has reported for phonological and lexical change and certain verb forms (i.e., morphological doublets), many changes can be pinpointed to the baby-boomer generation (Chambers 2002:369, 2004a:15). However, there are other changes in Canadian English with a clear quickening of pace in generations X and Y and on down into Generation ZED. Put into a socio-cultural context, the shear speed of ongoing change should not be a surprise. As Chambers has noted, "sociolinguistics provides a barometer of social change" (2004a:15). Recall, too, that these younger generations are growing up with unprecedented geographic and economic mobility, both key factors thought to hasten linguistic change (Chambers 2002). They are also the generations that have grown up with the internet, email, text and

interaction (Baron 2003, 2004). Here, too, much more research needs to
be done, yet the extreme points of acceleration correlate suggestively with the advent of these new communication media. Chambers has also observed that "linguistic change merely keeps pace with socio-cultural change" (2002:370). If these results are any indication, the acceleration of linguistic change I have documented here is a reflection of just how well Canadian English is keeping up with the times.

The Origins and Development of Canadian English
3.0 INTRODUCTION
3
 In order to understand where any dialect of English came from and why it has the shape that it does, it is necessary to understand what we might call its “language-external” history; that is, rather than focusing on its structural ele- ments, we focus on the history of its speakers. Why is English spoken so widely throughout the world, and in so many different ways? In the case of Canadian English, this requires an understanding of how English spread throughout the world and the sequence of events that led to this remarkable situation.
Before beginning this discussion, I’ll note that the word dialect is prob- lematic from a linguistic perspective. Apart from the negative connotations of the word (e.g. it is often used disparagingly for ways of speaking that differ from the written standard or that are used by people from more peripheral regions or lower social classes), the distinction between dialect and language is not made on the basis of purely linguistic considerations (such as similarities in vocabulary, pronunciation and grammar) or mutual intelligibility (i.e. the ability of speakers of each dialect to understand each other), but primarily because of social, cultural and political attitudes. To cite two commonly used examples, the Scandinavian languages (Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) are structurally very similar and mutually intelligible, yet the dialects of Chinese (i.e. its spoken forms, such as Cantonese and Mandarin) differ structurally in a number of ways and are not mutually intelligible. For these reasons, although I will often use the word dialect, in keeping with the literature on the topic, I will also use the more neutral term variety as much as possible to refer to forms of language that differ socially or regionally.

34 ORIGINSANDDEVELOPMENT
 3.1 THE ORIGIN AND SPREAD OF ENGLISH DIALECTS
English itself began as a dialect, or a group of dialects, spoken by people from what is now the Netherlands, northern Germany and Denmark. In the 5th and 6th centuries ad, these people, who spoke Germanic languages (related to such modern languages as German, Dutch and Frisian), migrated to and gradu- ally conquered most of Britain, an island that had been ruled by the Roman Empire and was populated by speakers of Celtic languages (the ancestors of today’s Welsh and Gaelic). Over the next several centuries their languages developed into a set of dialects that are now referred to as “Anglo-Saxon” or “Old English”. The lack of mixing between the speakers of Old English and the Celtic speakers they pushed to the fringes of the island meant that there was little Celtic influence on the development of English at that time. The greatest influence on Old English was exerted by the Vikings, who spoke Old Norse, and who occupied a large part of Britain under the Danelaw between the 9th and 11th centuries. With the conquest by the French-speaking Normans in 1066, French became the language of the court and nobility. At this point, Old English gave way to Middle English, the language used by Geoffrey Chaucer in poems such as The Canterbury Tales, written toward the end of the 14th century, by which time English had been reestablished as the language of the court. Middle English developed into Modern English beginning in the mid to late 15th century. Early Modern English, the language used by William Shake- speare, was still characterized by dialectal variation, but a written standard (based mostly on the English spoken in London, the capital) and a body of literature was beginning to be developed.
What is remarkable is that between the years 1500 and 2000 a language spoken by a million or so people in a marginal European island has become perhaps the most widely spoken language in human history. How did this come about?
English first began by dominating the British Isles. The principalities that made up Wales were conquered by England in the 13th century, followed by political union in 1536. Ireland was conquered by England, first by the (French- speaking) Normans (1169) and then by the (English-speaking) Tudors (1542). England never conquered Scotland, but the two kingdoms’ crowns were uni- fied under King James (I in England but VI in Scotland) in 1603, with political union following in 1707. Like Middle and Modern English, the Scots language was a descendant of the dialects of Old English. Scots competed with Gaelic and French in Scotland, but by the end of the 14th century it had become the dominant language of that kingdom. With the political union of the British Isles under England came increasing use of English for official purposes (law and trade) and a concomitant proscription of other languages (Gaelic in Scot- land, Welsh in Wales and Irish in Ireland).

ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT 35
 English began to spread out from the British Isles over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries, as England entered into the European enterprise of colonization and conquest, competing with other European powers, first Spain and France, then the Netherlands and Portugal. Although English explorers began to discover overseas lands in the 16th century (such as Newfoundland), the first permanent English-speaking settlement outside of the British Isles was at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, with other settlements along the eastern seaboard of North America to follow. English colonies were also founded in the Caribbean, at St Kitts (1623) and Barbados (1625–27), followed by other islands throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Colonies in central and South America were also established, though their control passed back and forth between England (later, Britain) and the other European powers.
While Britain established settlement colonies and plantations in North America and the Caribbean, its entry into trade in Asia (India, China and the East Indies) and Africa was characterized more by commercial and military colonies. British control of the Indian subcontinent began with trade colonies founded under the auspices of the East India Company in 1757, though India was made a colony of the British crown in 1858. Britain’s entry into Asia and the Pacific led to the discovery of lands such as Australia, first settled as a penal colony in 1788, and New Zealand, settled in 1840. The need to safeguard com- mercial routes from Asia around Africa prompted the seizure of the Cape of Good Hope in 1806, with later conquests of indigenous and Boer (Dutch) ter- ritories, leading to the formation of the colony of South Africa. Trade colonies were also established in the Malay peninsula (Penang in 1786, Singapore in 1819 and Malacca in 1824), in Burma (1826) and on Hong Kong island (1842). In the late 19th century, Britain was also involved with other European pow- ers in the “scramble for Africa”, acquiring territories in West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone) and East Africa (Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe).
The American Revolution removed most of the English-speaking colonies in North America from British control, and the 19th and 20th centuries saw an increasing degree of political autonomy from Britain in the other settlement colonies (Canada, Australia and New Zealand). Most of Ireland became inde- pendent from Britain in the early 20th century, and after the Second World War other overseas British colonies began to follow suit. The former British colonies of Asia and Africa underwent a process of decolonization, but the English language continued to play a role in these new countries to different degrees, either as a (co-)official language or as a language of higher educa- tion. Although the British Empire gradually dissolved and Britain’s worldwide power waned, the rise of the United States of America (another English- speaking country) as a superpower guaranteed the maintenance and world- wide spread of the English language, though increasingly through military and economic power rather than through colonialism and conquest.

FIGURE 3.1 The circles of World English Source: Adapted from Kachru 1992.
The idea of “World English” was proposed by the linguist Braj Kachru in the 1990s. In this model, World English can be viewed as an international set of interrelated dialects or varieties that can be characterized in three concentric circles (see Figure 3.1). In the Inner Circle, English is spoken (by most of the population) as a native language. The Inner Circle would include the former settlement colonies, now countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In the Outer Circle, English is primarily spoken as a second language. The Outer Circle includes the former colonies of Britain and the United States, countries such as India, the Philippines, Kenya, Nigeria, and so on. Finally, in the Expanding Circle, English is spoken as a foreign language. These are countries with no English- speaking settlement or colonial history, but where English is making increas- ing inroads as a language of international communication and trade. The Expanding Circle includes countries such as Russia, China, Japan and Brazil.
3.2 PRINCIPLESOFNEWDIALECTFORMATION
The previous section outlined the language-external factors leading to the ori- gins and spread of the English language around the world. In this section, we will focus on the development of the linguistic characteristics of the language as it spread. Why do the dialects of English have the form that they do? Any
 
ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT 37
 account of their development must take into consideration two opposing ten- dencies of language change, what David Crystal (2004) has called centripetal (or conservative) and centrifugal (or innovative) forces: centripetal forces act to maintain the unity of different ways of speaking as dialects of the same language, whereas centrifugal forces lead to greater differentiation of dialects.
The most common way of depicting relationships between languages (or dialects or varieties) is the family tree. By analogy with biology or genealogy, the family-tree model views languages as organisms that have parents that they descend from (although, unlike most biological organisms, they only have one parent). As illustrated in Figure 3.2, Language A gives rise to two differ- ent languages, B and C, whose similarities can be traced back to their com- mon inheritance from the parent Language A. For example, as outlined in the previous section, the varieties of English spoken in the British Isles 500 years ago gave rise to the current varieties of English spoken in the British Isles, in the United States, in Canada, and so on. The family-tree model operates on the assumption that language spreads through a process of transmission (or linguistic descent), which William Labov (2007: 346) defines as an “unbroken sequence of native-language acquisition by children”. Under this process, chil- dren acquire the forms and patterns of their parents (and other members of the community in which they are raised), faithfully replicate them and then serve as linguistic models for the next generation.
However, the family tree is not the only model of language relationships: language change can also spread by diffusion from one dialect to another (B  C or C  B), from the mother dialect to the daughters (AB or AC) or from the daughters to the mother (BA or CA). For example, the r-less pronunciation now associated with British English arose at a time after the North American colonies were founded, but began diffusing to the eastern ports of Boston, New York and Charleston. The process of diffusion obviously requires contact between communities (or between speakers from different communities), which normally involves contact between adults rather than transmission from adult to child. As William Labov (2007) points out, the difference in the agents of transmission and diffusion may result in different degrees of replication of features and patterns, depending on the intensity and

38 ORIGINSANDDEVELOPMENT
 duration of contact between languages: more faithful replication with trans- mission, less faithful replication with diffusion. The degree of transmission and diffusion may also be affected by isolation whether physical, geographic, linguistic or social.
Some similarities in related languages cannot be accounted for by either transmission or diffusion. As Edward Sapir (1921: 172) noted, there is a ten- dency for languages that trace their source to a common parent but have not been in contact with each other to develop in similar ways. For example, both Canadian English and Australian English feature the flapping of /t/ between vowels, despite not having developed in contact with each other. This process of drift (independent but parallel innovation) is difficult to account for via the model shown in Figure 3.2, and may require us to appeal to universals of language change or to tendencies inherent in the parent language.
Centrifugal forces of language change account for differences among vari- eties of the same language, which over time may become so great that these varieties can come to be viewed as different languages. For example, the lan- guages of Europe that are now classed as Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian and so on) were originally regional varieties of Latin spoken in different parts of the Roman Empire that diverged over time. Centrifugal forces help to explain some of the differences between the circles of World English proposed by Kachru (Figure 3.2). A number of theo- ries have been developed to account for differences in the development of new dialects (some specifically within the context of English; e.g. Mufwene 2001, 2008; Schneider 2007; Trudgill 2004), but they converge on a number of points.
Most new dialects arise in conditions of colonization, in which a popula- tion of speakers of a language moves into a new region. A first consideration in new-dialect formation is the initial conditions of the settlement: whether the settlers were the first arrivals in the region, where they came from and what dialects they already spoke. New arrivals to a region where there is already a population that speaks the same language are more likely to assimilate to local ways of speaking than to develop a new dialect. In a situation that Peter Trudgill (2004) refers to as a tabula rasa (“clean slate”), new arrivals to a region where there is no other substantial preexisting population that speaks the same lan- guage may set the linguistic patterns for future arrivals, under what Salikoko Mufwene (2001) calls the “founder principle” (or the “founder effect”). How- ever, the strength of the founder effect depends on a number of other consider- ations, having to do with sheer numbers of speakers (demographics) and with social conditions, such as the degree of inequality and segregation between the settlers and other populations. If subsequent arrivals increase the population only gradually, the founder effect is likely to hold, because of the above-noted tendency for new arrivals to assimilate to local ways of speaking; in contrast, large-scale immigration by speakers of other dialects may minimize or over- turn the founder effect. Another consideration is the type of colony (Mufwene

ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT 39
 2001). Fort or trade colonies, such as those founded in Asia and Africa, were established for specific, limited purposes (usually, defense, conquest or trade) and were characterized by limited input of European populations and a restric- tion of communication with other populations to specific functions. The plantation colonies established in the Caribbean and the Pacific between the 17th and 19th centuries for large-scale farming of specific crops, such as sugar and cotton, involved a small and limited number of European managers or settlers and importation of much larger populations of slaves or indentured laborers. In these colonies, there was a large demographic imbalance among speakers of different languages, a high degree of social inequality and segrega- tion and varying levels of communication between the different populations. The settlement colonies founded in North America, Australia, New Zealand and (parts of) South Africa involved large-scale immigration and permanent settlement from the British Isles. Settlement colonies were characterized by a higher degree of native-speaker transmission across generations, while colo- nies with a higher proportion of non-native speaker immigrants and more limited communication would have entailed processes of second-language acquisition and language shift by the immigrant groups, with more radical linguistic restructuring, leading to the simplification and overgeneralization of linguistic rules.
Even in colonial situations where native-speaker transmission was main- tained, the resulting dialect would have been influenced by the mix of dia- lect features that the settlers brought with them to the new community, what Salikoko Mufwene (2001) has referred to as the “feature pool”. As in popula- tion genetics, the new dialect would result from a combination of the initial feature pool and the (social and linguistic) conditions that favoured the selec- tion of particular features. If the settlers were relatively homogeneous in terms of the dialect area from which they originated (monogenesis), the new dialect would likely resemble the old one. However, if the settlers’ origins were dialec- tally heterogeneous, the initial feature pool would be characterized by a high degree of interdialectal variation. The emergence of the new dialect would then involve stabilization of this variation in different ways.
The most likely outcome of interdialectal variation is some degree of dialect leveling (or koinéization, from the Greek word koiné, meaning “common”), in which certain dialect features survive and others disappear, though the exact linguistic outcome of dialect leveling depends on social and linguistic condi- tions. Demographics is one consideration: linguistic features or patterns that are associated with a dialect that is spoken by a majority of the settlers has a greater chance of survival than those that are spoken by a minority. Another consideration is how marked a linguistic feature is: for example, certain sounds are more unusual in English dialects (such as the velar fricative [x] or front rounded vowels, both of which are found in some dialects of Scottish English) and certain past-tense forms are more irregular (such as et for ate or riz for

40 ORIGINSANDDEVELOPMENT
 rose). Features that are linguistically marked tend to be lost, even if they occur in the speech of a large number of settlers. Another possible resolution of dia- lectal variation is the reallocation of dialect features (Trudgill 2004), either as social or stylistic variants (functional or social reallocation) or as variants that differ in their linguistic conditioning (structural or linguistic reallocation). For example, Peter Trudgill (2006) suggests that the phonological context of Canadian Raising (before voiceless consonants; see Chapter 5, p. 82) arose as a structural reallocation of variants introduced by Scottish settlers. Finally, Roger Lass (1990) has noted a curious effect in the development of new dia- lects of English that he calls “swamping”, which is the tendency for southeastern (i.e. London) features to be favoured in new-dialect formation, regardless of the degree of demographic input from the southeast. Swamping may be related to the importance of linguistic ideology in maintaining or developing norms of language use, either informally (through language attitudes) or formally (through institutional and educational means). The stabilization of dialects (or “focusing”, to use Le Page and Tabouret-Keller’s [1985] term) in most colonies began as exonormative (Schneider 2007); that is, they looked to Britain for lin- guistic norms. As the colonies developed political and cultural autonomy from Britain, the development of local norms led to endonormative stabilization.
Different models of new-dialect formation all agree on three main general- izations. First, no two colonies have exactly the same history: each colony was subject to different social, historical and demographic factors, and they would have passed through different stages of new-dialect formation at different rates. Second, the social and linguistic factors discussed above are probabilistic: linguistic outcomes cannot be predicted beforehand but may only be under- stood in retrospect. Finally, language-external considerations are paramount in accounting for the shape of a new dialect: even given the same mix of demo- graphic and linguistic features, no two dialects will be linguistically identical.
3.3 THE HISTORY OF CANADIAN ENGLISH
Having provided a general history of the origins of English and its spread around the world, and having outlined the important considerations involved in accounting for the emergence of new dialects, in this section I present a chronological account of the important historical events that were relevant to the formation of English in Canada.

The first human presence in what is now Canada consisted of people who migrated from Asia across the Bering land bridge between Siberia and Alaska between 7,000 and 12,000 years ago. These travelers spoke languages that, as

3.3.1 PrerevolutionaryCanada
The first human presence in what is now Canada consisted of people who migrated from Asia across the Bering land bridge between Siberia and Alaska between 7,000 and 12,000 years ago. These travelers spoke languages that, as

ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT 41
 they traveled further south, divided even further into groups or families of languages that were spread throughout North and South America. At the time of European arrival in the 16th and 17th centuries, it is estimated that up to 300 languages were spoken by about 350,000 people in the territory now con- tained by Canada. Most of the original population was killed off by infec- tious diseases and the genocidal policies of many of the settlers. Nowadays, fewer than 100 of these aboriginal (or “First Nations”) languages are spoken in Canada, with small numbers of speakers, most of whom have shifted to one of the official languages, English or French.
Europeans paid sporadic or seasonal visits to the island that is now known as Newfoundland, but the first substantial European presence in mainland Canada dates to the two French colonies founded by Samuel de Champlain in the early 17th century: Acadia (Acadie), founded in 1604 (in present-day Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island [originally called Île St Jean]), and Nouvelle France (“New France”, nowadays Québec), which was established in 1609 along the St Lawrence River. Although there are many French-speaking communities elsewhere in Canada, the bulk of Canada’s French-speaking population still resides in these two areas.
The English presence in Canada can be traced to two original sources: the island of Newfoundland, which lies at the extreme eastern edge of northern North America, and the 13 colonies established north to south along the east- ern seaboard of middle North America.
Newfoundland had been visited by Scandinavians for centuries before it was (re)discovered in 1497 by the Venetian navigator John Cabot (Zuan Chabotto) under the sponsorship of England’s King Henry VII. It served as a seasonal fishery for the French, Basques, Portuguese and Spanish but was claimed for the English Crown in 1583. Permanent settlements began to be established in the 17th century, with immigration almost exclusively from southwestern England (Dorset, Devon and Cornwall) and southeastern Ireland (Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Tipperary and Cork). By 1750 the permanent population was no more than about 5,000 (Clarke 2010b), though it increased to about 100,000 by 1850, with immigration continuing to come from the same sources. Due to the homogeneity of its settler input and its geographical and political isola- tion (until relatively recently), the linguistic characteristics of Newfoundland are quite different from those of the rest of English-speaking North America.
The 13 English-speaking colonies in mid-Atlantic North America were established gradually throughout the 17th and 18th centuries: Virginia in 1607 (although it had been unsuccessfully settled in the 16th century), Massachu- setts in 1628, Maryland in 1632, Rhode Island in 1636 (originally settled as Providence), Connecticut in 1636, North and South Carolina in 1663 (origi- nally as one colony, then divided in two in 1691), New York and New Jersey in 1664 (both originally part of the New Netherlands colony settled by the Dutch

 42 ORIGINSANDDEVELOPMENT
 in the early 1600s), Delaware in 1664, Pennsylvania in 1681, New Hampshire in 1691 and Georgia in 1732. By the mid-1700s, the population of these colonies (excluding slaves) stood at about 1.5 million. For the most part, the colonists were English-speaking emigrants from various parts of the British Isles, although some of the colonies had already been settled by speakers of Dutch and Swedish. As shown in Figure 3.3, these English-speaking colonies were on the edge of a continent still populated predominantly by aboriginal societies, but held by France and Spain.
The course of the 18th century saw a series of European wars between Brit- ain and France also played out in North America between the neighbouring

 British and French colonies (each of which was allied with different aboriginal nations). Over the course of 50 years, Britain gradually gained control over more and more North American territory.
During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14), French Acadia was conquered by Britain, which was allowed to keep it under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) (though without Île Royale, later Cape Breton Island). To counter the French fortress at Louisbourg (in Île Royale), the British estab- lished the port city of Halifax in 1749, bringing in 3,000 English-speaking set- tlers (mainly from Britain, New England and Newfoundland) and establishing the new province of Nova Scotia. A few years later, the English-speaking set- tlers were followed by over 2,000 Protestant German-speaking settlers from parts of what are now Germany and Switzerland (Wynne 1987a). Although the British at first tolerated the existence of French-speaking Acadians in the province, their refusal to sign oaths of loyalty to the British Crown in the ongoing battles with France, coupled with the interest of New Englanders in obtaining Acadian land, led to the forced deportation of many Acadians to the southern British colonies and to Louisiana between 1755 and 1758. Follow- ing this deportation, their land was settled by about 8,000 “Yankee planters” from New England. By 1776, there were about 70,000 people in Nova Scotia, a third of them concentrated in Halifax, though most of the population spoke an aboriginal language (Mi’kmaq or Maliseet) or French (Wynne 1987b).
The British conquest of the eastern half of North America was complete at the end of the Seven Years’ War (1755–63, also known as the French and Indian War), during which the French fortresses at Louisbourg (1758), Québec (1759) and Montréal (1760) were captured. These gains were consolidated under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763), in which Britain gained all the territories of French North America (except for the islands of St Pierre and Miquelon, off the southeast of Newfoundland, which are still part of France to this day)—a vast swath of land that stretched from Acadia in the northeast, through the St Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, and south through the land east of the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico (see Figure 3.4). Although the Ameri- can colonists to the south had assumed that their new fellow-subjects of the British Crown would be assimilated into their largely Protestant and English- speaking society, the British Parliament’s passage of the Quebec Act (1774) guaranteed the Quebec colonists their right to remain French-speaking and Catholic and to retain their legal system. Despite a slight influx of English speakers from the American colonies into this territory over the next 13 years, the vast majority of its 70,000 inhabitants remained French speaking.
Thus, by 1776 there were no more than 25,000 speakers of English in all of what is now Canada, with only a few hundred in the new province of Quebec (present-day Ontario and Quebec) (Orkin 1970; Wynne 1987a, 1987b).

3.3.2 TheAmericanRevolutionandtheArrivaloftheLoyalists
In the 1760s and 1770s, disputes between the American colonists and the Brit- ish government over taxation and restrictions on the expansion of the colonies into the newly acquired territories to the north and west (as well as the Quebec Act) escalated into armed rebellion. The Declaration of Independence from Britain (1776) by the Continental Congress began a seven-year war to decide the fate of the colonies. As it became clear that the rebellion was becoming a successful war of independence, many of those American colonists who did not wish to sever political ties with the mother country, who became known as “United Empire Loyalists” (or simply, “Loyalists”), were debarred from power and came under increasing attack from American Patriots. While some Loyal- ists were able to travel overland to Quebec via the frontiers at the Niagara and St Lawrence rivers (see Figure 3.5A), many gathered in New York City, one of the last holdouts of the British troops.
Before surrendering New York to General George Washington, the com- mander of the British forces, Sir Guy Carleton, negotiated the safe passage of Loyalists out of the city by sea. Many Loyalists made their way to Britain or ended up in more far-flung locales (such as the Bahamas, Jamaica and

even India), but the main destination was the British North American prov- inces that had not participated in the American Revolution: Nova Scotia and Quebec.
In October and November of 1783, some 30,000 Loyalists set sail from New York City to Halifax (Jasanoff 2011; Taylor 2007). Among them were about 3,000 “Black Loyalists”, most of them former slaves from Virginia and South Carolina who had heeded the proclamation by the British governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, that any African American slaves who helped the British resist the rebellion would be granted their freedom at the end of the war (Walker 1993).
The arrival of so many English-speaking refugees in Nova Scotia created administrative problems that were resolved by partitioning the province between the peninsula, where about 19,000 Loyalists settled, and a new prov- ince on the mainland called New Brunswick, where some 15,000 Loyalists

 settled (Jasanoff 2011). While most of the Loyalist settlers in peninsular Nova Scotia tended to come from Massachusetts, the origins of those who settled in New Brunswick were more mixed: some came from New England, but the majority were from the mid-Atlantic colonies (New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania) (Wynne 1987b). A small number (500) settled in the Island of St John (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1794). The Black Loyalists experi- enced a certain amount of hostility from the other settlers and were settled in separate communities. By 1792, half of them volunteered to be resettled in the African colony of Freetown, Sierra Leone (Walker 1993). Thus, in 1800, the four Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island) contained about 80,000 people, half of them Eng- lish speakers, most of them hailing from New England and the mid-Atlantic colonies.
As mentioned earlier, the province of Quebec was already an overland des- tination for Loyalist refugees during the Revolutionary War. Between 1779 and 1784, some 6,000 Loyalists arrived, most of whom settled in the upper St Lawrence River area, establishing the town of Kingston (at the head of Lake Ontario), and around the Bay of Quinte, although there was also a settlement in the Niagara region (Jasanoff 2011). By 1785 there were about 7,000 Loyal- ists in the western part of the province, about half of them consisting of dis- charged British and German soldiers and their families or dependents, with the rest consisting of refugees who had migrated overland or who had origi- nally sailed from New York and entered Quebec through the Maritime prov- inces (Knowles 1997). By 1791 the growing English-speaking population in the west (about 14,000) led the British to partition Quebec along the Ottawa River, with the eastern part becoming the (predominantly French-speaking) province of Lower Canada and the western part becoming the (predominantly English-speaking) province of Upper Canada (see Figure 3.5B).
The governor of the new province of Upper Canada was John Graves Simcoe, a British officer who had fought in the Revolutionary War, and who saw his task in the province as building an alternative Loyalist British North American society that would show the rebellious colonists to the south the errors of their ways (Craig 1963). Simcoe located the provincial capital at (Fort) York (later renamed Toronto) and concentrated on developing and settling the land in the western part of Upper Canada, where the Loyalists had not settled in any great numbers. His goal was to lure some of the American settlers who were migrating northwest from the mid-Atlantic states (New Jer- sey, New York and Pennsylvania) to Upper Canada.
Although the American settlers who arrived after 1791 are usually referred to as the “late Loyalists”, this name is a little misleading, because their political allegiance and their motives for settling in Canada differed from those of the United Empire Loyalists. Rather than being motivated by political loyalty to

48 ORIGINSANDDEVELOPMENT
 the British Crown, they were enticed by Simcoe’s offers of cheap land and rates of taxation that were lower than those in the newly founded United States (ironically, taxation had been one of the grievances of the American revolu- tionaries). Over the next 20 years, the arrival of these late Loyalists increased the population of Upper Canada from 14,000 to 70,000. They settled the north shore of Lake Ontario and the country north of York, and founded communi- ties along the Grand and Thames rivers (Taylor 2007).
By 1812, the population of Upper Canada was estimated to be between 75,000 (Craig 1963; Dollinger 2008 says 83,000) and 100,000 (Craig 1963; Knowles 1997; Landon 1967). There were speakers of languages other than English: German was spoken along the upper St Lawrence, as well as Low Ger- man, spoken by Mennonites from New Jersey and Pennsylvania in Markham, Niagara and along the Grand River; speakers of Gaelic could be found in northeastern Upper Canada, and there were French-speaking communities along the Detroit and Ottawa rivers. However, the overwhelming majority of the population was English-speaking, consisting of the late Loyalists, followed by the United Empire Loyalists and British/Irish immigrants, with smaller numbers of Quakers from Pennsylvania and Black Loyalists.
3.3.3 TheWarof1812andItsAftermath
In 1812, the United States, under President James Madison, declared war on Britain, citing a number of grievances having to do with restrictions on trade and sovereignty. Among the American war goals was the annexation of Can- ada, a task that a previous president, Thomas Jefferson, had declared to be a “matter of mere marching”. Although there were some American victories in the war (such as the burning of York, for which the British retaliated by burning the new American capital of Washington), the three-year war was unsuccessful in its goal of seizing Canada. The main outcome of the war was a consolidation of American sovereignty, but it also had the unintended side effect of instilling a sense of national identity among Canadians (and perhaps the beginning of a strain of anti-Americanism that persists among Canadians to the present). Throughout the War of 1812, Britain had also been engaged in another war, fought in Europe against the French dictator Napoleon Bonaparte. When both wars ended in 1815, Britain could once again turn its attention to its North American colonies.
Although the citizens of Upper Canada had acquitted themselves well in the War of 1812, the British government worried about the extent to which the province had been settled by Americans who were not necessarily ideologically or politically sound when it came to allegiance to the British Empire. There was a concern that a continued and increasing Americanization of the popula- tion could lead to another war, or even to a second American revolution. After 1815, further immigration from the United States was discouraged.

ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT 49
 To increase the English-speaking population of British North America, the government instead encouraged immigration from the British Isles through offers of cheap land and, in some cases, free passage across the Atlantic. Although initially unsuccessful, rising unemployment and a series of famines in Britain and Ireland in the 1840s stimulated large-scale emigration. Between 1815 and 1867, it is estimated that over a million people migrated from the British Isles to British North America (Cowan 1961, 1968; Taylor 2007). The bulk of these immigrants came not from London or the south of England, but rather from the more peripheral regions of the British Isles: northern England, Scotland and Ireland. While it is difficult to get an exact idea of the composition of set- tlers (the first census of British North America did not occur until 1851), one indication is given by the origins of immigrants arriving at Quebec, the main port of entry to Lower and Upper Canada. As Figure 3.6 shows, between 1829 and the 1850s immigration to Canada was dominated by arrivals from Ireland. However, this figure does not show the division of arrivals by religion: before 1845, most of the Irish immigrants were Protestant (coming from the north- ern counties of Ireland), and it was only after the first of the potato famines in the 1840s that the Catholic Irish immigrated in any large numbers (Brunger 1990: 254). Throughout the first half of the 19th century, the English were the second-largest immigrant group, but the numbers for “English” in Figure 3.6 include emigrants from Wales, and, as noted earlier, the majority of the English immigrants came from the north of England. Scottish immigrants constituted the third-largest group in this period, although lower-class labourers, farm- ers and shepherds from Scotland had already begun arriving in Canada in the 1820s, settling the Rideau River valley, the town of Perth and Lanark County.

These new arrivals did not immediately integrate with the existing popu- lation of Upper Canada. In contrast with the United Empire Loyalists and the late Loyalists, who had tended to settle in already-established counties and in towns such as Kingston, York (later, Toronto) and London, the new British and Irish immigrants who arrived between 1815 and 1867 moved into previously unsettled areas of Upper Canada, although they did not set- tle together (Brunger 1990: 257). Most of the Scottish immigrants to Upper Canada founded communities in the unsettled southwestern area between Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron, giving recognizably Scottish names to towns such as Fergus, Elora and Kincardine (see Figure 3.7) (Brunger 1990: 251). The Protestant Irish (who were twice as numerous as the Catholics) settled the area northwest of Toronto, founding towns such as Orangeville (Brunger 1990: 254), while the Catholic Irish tended to settle in the nonagricultural eastern areas, working in wage-labour industries such as lumber, rather than farming (Brunger 1990: 257).
Immigration in the 19th century came primarily from the British Isles, but after 1846 immigration to British North America was opened up to “Germans” (these German-speaking settlers came not only from what is now Germany but also from Austria and Hungary) and to immigrants from other areas of Europe (as can be seen in Figure 3.8), albeit in much smaller numbers. In the 1850s, the German-speaking nations of Europe lost 200,000 emigrants due to economic and agricultural problems similar to those experienced in Ireland and Britain during the same period. By 1862, over 40,000 German speakers

had arrived in British North America, along with almost 15,000 Scandinavians (Cowan 1961). Apart from the previously mentioned Black Loyalists who had settled in Nova Scotia, approximately 60,000 African Americans fleeing slavery through the Underground Railroad arrived in southwestern Ontario between 1820 and 1860 and settled in southwestern towns such as Windsor and Cha- tham, although some continued to Toronto (Bordewich 2005; Winks 1997).
Thus, the English spoken in 19th-century Canada can be seen to coexist with a smaller number of speakers of other languages (apart from the remain- ing aboriginal languages, there were speakers of French, German, Gaelic and Scandinavian languages).
3.3.4 ConfederationandWestwardExpansion
By the middle of the 19th century, the growing population of Canada showed signs of a desire for greater autonomy and participatory democracy. Rebel- lions took place in 1837 in both Upper and Lower Canada attempting to wrest political control of the provinces away from their oligarchical elites. Both rebellions were quickly put down, but they did lead to a widening of partici- pation in government. Following the rebellions, Lord Durham was sent to British North America to assess whether any changes should be made to the way the provinces were governed. His Report of the Affairs of British North America (1838) made a number of recommendations, among them reunit- ing Upper and Lower Canada into a single province. In 1864, a conference debating a union of the Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island), held in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, was joined by delegates from Canada, and resulted in another conference in

52 ORIGINSANDDEVELOPMENT
 Quebec City later that year that included Newfoundland in the discussions. In 1867 these conferences led to the British Parliament’s passage of the Brit- ish North America Act, which united the provinces of Canada West and East (now renamed as Ontario and Quebec, respectively), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into the Dominion of Canada (Prince Edward Island did not join Confederation until 1873). Sir John A. MacDonald, one of the Canadian del- egates to the Charlottetown and Quebec conferences, became the first prime minister. The territories of northwestern British North America (Rupert’s Land and the Northwest Territories), owned by the Hudson’s Bay Company since 1670, were bought by British Crown and passed on to the new gov- ernment of Canada in 1869–70, which created the provinces of Manitoba (1870, though with much smaller boundaries than it has today) and British Columbia (1871). Although the Canadian government encouraged settle- ment in this new territory by offering free land to any man over the age of 21 who would cultivate and live on it for at least three years, this policy was not successful until the end of the 19th century, when an improvement in the economies of North America and Europe increased the demand for Cana- dian agricultural products such as wheat. The prime minister at that time, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, made settling the west a top priority, not only promot- ing immigration to Canada abroad in the British Isles and Europe, but also lifting restrictions on immigration from the United States. While arrivals from Germany and Scandinavia generally declined in this period, immigra- tion from the British Isles increased. This period also saw the beginning of immigration from southern Europe (Italy and Greece) and eastern Europe (primarily from the Ukraine and, to a lesser extent, Russia, as well as from German-speaking parts of eastern Europe) (Kelley and Trebilcock 1998). The second-largest group of immigrants came from the United States, though many of these “American” immigrants were themselves recent arrivals from central and northern Europe. The settlement of the western provinces and territories was facilitated by the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), which had been built between 1881 and 1885 in fulfillment of a promise to British Columbia when it joined Confederation. The increasing western population led to the creation of two new provinces in 1905, Sas- katchewan and Alberta. Immigration to Canada only began to decline dur- ing the First World War, which obviously impeded international migration.
During this time, Newfoundland had also been gaining political autonomy from Britain. In 1832 it formed a colonial assembly and became a self-governing colony in 1854. Although it was granted the status of a Dominion in 1907, bankruptcy led to a return to colonial status until Newfoundland joined the Canadian Confederation in 1949. The large-scale immigration which char- acterized Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries largely bypassed Newfoundland.

 3.3.5 Canadainthe20thCentury—andBeyond
Until the First World War, Canada had remained an essentially “British” col- ony, with the bulk of its English-speaking population tracing its origins to the British Isles, either directly or indirectly through the United States. Over the course of the 20th century, as Canada gradually gained political autonomy from the United Kingdom, the demographic nature of the Canadian popula- tion began to change.
In the late 19th century, admitting immigrants from other European back- grounds was necessary to help ensure Canadian sovereignty by settling the lands it held, as well as filling a growing labour shortage. However, given pub- lic concerns that too much non-British immigration would dilute the white Anglo-Saxon nature of the Dominion, the Canadian government passed a number of restrictive immigration laws that persisted well into the 20th cen- tury. These laws were primarily aimed at restricting or barring immigration from visibly different racial groups. Although, as mentioned earlier, a number of African Americans had settled in British North America, either as Loyal- ist refugees or through the Underground Railroad, further black immigration was not encouraged (emancipation of slaves in the United States in 1865 and southern poverty during the Reconstruction era also deterred further African American immigration). During the construction of the CPR, the need for cheap labour led to railroad companies recruiting Chinese “guest workers”, first from California (where many Chinese men had arrived during the gold rush of the 1850s) and later directly from Guangdong and Taiwan. However, these men were discouraged from bringing their families to Canada to settle permanently, and after the completion of the CPR in 1885 the Canadian gov- ernment imposed a “head tax” of $50 (increased to $100 in 1900 and then to $500 in 1903) on each Chinese immigrant to Canada as a means of mini- mizing Asian immigration (Li 1998). In 1923, immigration from China was banned outright by the Chinese Immigration (or Exclusion) Act, a law that was not repealed until 1947.
Canada’s political autonomy increased after the First World War. The Brit- ish Parliament’s passage of the Statute of Westminster (1931) granted formal equality to the other Parliaments of all self-governing Dominions within the British Empire. Although the British monarch was retained as the head of state (locally represented by a governor-general), the Canadian Parliament could pass its own laws without approval from Great Britain. The Canadian Citizen- ship Act was passed in 1946 and went into effect in 1947. In 1965, the Cana- dian government replaced its British-themed Red Ensign flag with the current Maple Leaf flag.
During the 1960s, Canada also began officially to recognize its de facto bilingual and increasingly multicultural nature. The Royal Commission on

       54 ORIGINSANDDEVELOPMENT
 Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963–67) convened by Prime Minister Lester Pearson recommended a policy of “bilingualism within a multicultural frame- work”. Under this policy, English and French would be recognized as official languages of the federal government. Although other languages would not be recognized as official, multiculturalism would encourage people to retain the cultural practices that they brought with them from elsewhere. This policy was enacted in the Official Languages Act (1969), and, with the repatriation of the Canadian Constitution (1982), the language laws were further enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
From a demographic perspective, the most significant change in Canadian government policy is undoubtedly the new Immigration Act of 1962, which removed all barriers of race, religion and country of origin from immigra- tion. Canadian immigration was later refined into a system in which poten- tial immigrants are awarded points for knowledge of either official language, needed skills, age and financial assets.
These changes to the act resulted in visible (and audible) changes in the eth- nic, cultural and linguistic composition of the Canadian population. Figure 3.9 shows the relative proportions of origins for immigrants to Canada from 1900 to 1980. At the beginning of the 20th century, the bulk of immigration was still British, with sizeable proportions from the United States and Europe.

from 1921 to 1980, shown in Figure 3.10, reveals a marked shift in the compo- sition of this category: declining proportions of immigrants from Scandina- via, Ukraine and Russia (groups who helped to settle the western provinces at the turn of the 20th century) and increasing proportions of immigrants from German-speaking Europe ([West] Germany, Austria and Switzerland), France and the Low Countries (the Netherlands and Belgium). However, the sharpest gains are in the relative proportions of immigrants from what is sometimes referred to as “southern Europe”: Italy (primarily from Sicily and Calabria), Portugal (primarily from the Azores Islands) and Greece. In contrast with the groups who had settled the west at the turn of the century, these groups tended to settle in the larger cities, especially Montreal and Toronto.
After the 1980s, the picture of immigration to Canada begins to change even more radically. As Figure 3.11 shows, the relative proportion of immigra- tion from the British Isles, the United States and Europe declines sharply, and we begin to see rising immigration from new areas, such as the Caribbean, the Middle East and Latin and South America. However, the steepest rise is among the category marked “Asia”. If we examine the breakdown of this category more closely, as in Figure 3.12, we see that some of the groups that predominated prior to 1991 have either remained constant (the Philippines) or have declined (Hong Kong, Vietnam), while others have not only continued but have come to occupy a greater proportion of immigration from Asia (mainland China and India). Thus, within the last 30 years, the face of immigration to Canada has shifted from Europe to Asia, and in particular to two large source countries in Asia: China and India. Moreover, as was the case with the later European immigration from southern Europe after the Second World War, these newer Asian immigrants have tended to settle in the larger cities.

 3.4 CANADIANENGLISHASANEWDIALECT
Now that we have reviewed the important historical, social and demographic events in the history of English-speaking Canada, we are in a position to examine the development of Canadian English in light of different theories of new-dialect formation. In examining this development, it is important to dis- tinguish between the histories of the different geographical regions that served as the origins of the different English-speaking populations in Canada.
Newfoundland stands as a special case in the history of Canadian English, from both a historical and a geographic perspective. Having been settled almost exclusively from two regions of the British Isles (southwestern England and southeastern Ireland), and because settlers from these regions tended to settle together in different parts of the island, the establishment of New- foundland English can be seen as a case of monogenesis par excellence. Cur- rent Newfoundland English shows few signs of the dialect mixture exhibited in other areas of North America (see Chapters 4–6). In addition, because of its geographical isolation and its independent political status, the large-scale immigration that characterized other parts of Canada has largely bypassed this province. Only since joining Confederation in 1949 has Newfoundland shown any signs in its English of accommodating to the national standard (Chambers 1991).
Across all regions of what is now Canada, the initial settlement of English speakers conforms with the requirements of a tabula rasa situation. At the time of the European arrival, there were indigenous populations who spoke aboriginal languages (Beothuk in Newfoundland, Mi’kmaq and Maliseet in Nova Scotia, various Algonquian and Iroquoian languages in Canada), but these populations were rapidly and severely reduced by diseases, warfare (with each other and with the European powers and colonists) and genocide, and thus contributed very little to the later development of English in Canada, beyond place names and a number of culturally specific words. Similarly, although there were substantial populations of French speakers in Nova Scotia and Quebec when Britain took possession of these colonies, the deportation of French speakers from Acadia and the maintenance of separate legal and lin- guistic rights for the French population of Quebec meant that their contribu- tion to later development of Canadian English was also minimal, and largely restricted to the lexicon.
The establishment of the English-speaking American colonies along the eastern seaboard in the 17th and 18th centuries would already have featured contact between speakers of dialects from different parts of the British Isles, resulting in dialect leveling and the emergence of new, American dialects of English. Because of the different mixes of the input populations in each col- ony, there would already have been differences in the dialect spoken in each

58 ORIGINSANDDEVELOPMENT
 colony, which persist as regional differences to this day: the New England states, the mid-Atlantic states (New York, Pennsylvania) and the southern states.
As we have seen, parts of Nova Scotia had been settled before the Ameri- can Revolution by “Yankees” from New England, who doubtless brought New England ways of speaking with them. Although there was an influx of Loyalists from both New England and the mid-Atlantic states after the American Revo- lution, the founder principle suggests that the degree of further dialect contact and leveling would have been minimal.
In contrast, at the time of the American Revolution, the lands of western Quebec had no substantial English-speaking population. Since the Loyalist arrivals to this region would have come primarily from the western parts of New England and the inland parts of New York and Pennsylvania, the initial input to (Upper) Canada would have consisted in a mixture of American dia- lects from these different regions. Further mixing would have taken place with ongoing American input in the form of the late Loyalists. This overwhelm- ingly American source for the initial English-speaking population to Canada led Morton Bloomfield (1948/1975: 6) to formulate a Loyalist origins theory, arguing that Canadian English is “basically eighteenth century American English modified by other influences”.
After the War of 1812, with further American immigration largely cut off, the large-scale immigration from different parts of the British Isles would have overwhelmed the smaller existing population. Mark Orkin (1970) presents evidence that a wide variety of British accents could be heard in Canada dur- ing the 19th century. This period must have featured another stage of dialect leveling, between the American dialect(s) already spoken in Canada and the incoming mix of British dialects, most of them from Ireland, Scotland and northern England. This British influence led to a second theory about the ori- gins of Canadian English, first promoted by Matthew Scargill (1957/1975), who argued that the British-dialect input might have overpowered the founder effect of the Loyalist population. More recently, Charles Boberg (2004b: 355) has taken a more nuanced position, characterizing Canadian English as a “standard Southern British superstratum . . . imposed on a North American variety”. Similarly, Peter Trudgill (2006: 272) views Canadian English as “a mixed dialect par excellence”.
The 19th century was also a period in which exonormative forces competed in the stabilization of Canadian English. The founding population spoke American varieties of English but were flooded by immigrants speaking an array of British and Irish varieties. In addition, British North America offi- cially looked to the mother country and metropole for linguistic standards, but geographically (and perhaps culturally) the emerging American standard was much closer. Spelling reforms proposed by Noah Webster in his 1828 dic- tionary had been widely adopted in the United States to symbolize growing

ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT 59
 American linguistic autonomy and nationalism, and American schoolbooks and teachers were much more plentiful in Upper Canada than were their Brit- ish counterparts. J.K. Chambers (1993) presents evidence from this period showing that educated British English was the object of overt prestige and that local (American) ways of speech were viewed as inferior. However, it may be argued that it is precisely this mixed heritage that was crucial in developing an English Canadian identity. In 1844, John Robert Godley remarked that a national character was forming, distinctive from both American and British, and it is in 1857 that the term “Canadian English” was first used (by the Rev- erend Geikie, although in a pejorative sense).
By the end of the 19th century we start to see the beginnings of “standard” Canadian English as we know it today, one that is characterized by the absence of regional variation (at least for the thousands of miles between the Ottawa River and Vancouver Island). This homogeneity may stem from two factors: the rapid settlement of the west, which was not opened up for large-scale population until its acquisition after Confederation, and the fact that most of this settlement took place from or through Ontario. Despite the increase in immigrants of central and eastern European background, their children and grandchildren would have tended to shift to English, and the model for that English had already been established in eastern Canada.
During the 20th century, with increasing political autonomy and its exter- nal symbols (Canadian citizenship, a Canadian flag, a national anthem) came increasing concern about documenting and codifying Canadian English. The formation of English Canadian identity came with a rejection of American standards and what J.K. Chambers (1998b) has called a “rabid national- ism”. As the 20th century progressed and the immigration patterns of Can- ada’s population changed, Canada began to redefine itself as an immigration nation, embracing official bilingualism multiculturalism, as well as de facto multilingualism.
A major consequence of the changing patterns of Canadian immigration has been a change in the ethnic and linguistic nature of the urban landscape. Unlike the immigrants who arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to settle the west, late-20th century immigrants have tended to settle in the larg- est cities: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. These more recent immigrants have also come from a wider array of ethnic and linguistic backgrounds than in the past. Although they and their descendants have shifted to English at vary- ing rates, the appearance of urban forms of Canadian English that differenti- ate speakers according to their ethnic background has been noted. These newer forms of Canadian English raise interesting questions. Do they ultimately derive from transfer from the languages that the immigrant parents and grandparents brought with them (Chambers 1998b)? Will they persist, and will they affect the future shape of Canadian English? We will explore this question in Chapter 7.

 SUMMARY
This chapter provided an account of the language-external history that led to the origins and development of English in Canada. We began by outlining the origins and spread of English from Britain to its current status as a worldwide lingua franca, invoking Kachru’s concept of World English as a set of concen- tric circles characterized by the degree to which English is a native language. In order to understand why Canadian English has its current shape, we con- sidered several theories of new-dialect formation. Processes of language trans- mission and diffusion, founder effects, dialect mixing and language contact can be invoked to understand the similarities and differences between varieties of English.
Having outlined general principles of new-dialect formation, we then out- lined a history of the English-speaking people in Canada, beginning with the settlement of Newfoundland and the movement of American Loyalists into what had been a predominantly French-speaking colony. After the War of 1812, the Loyalists were overwhelmed by immigration from the British Isles. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, immigration was opened to western and eastern Europe, with a further opening of immigration through- out the 20th century, leading to profound changes in the ethnic composition of English-speaking Canada by the beginning of the 21st century.
We concluded with some consideration of how these historical, social and demographic forces can be applied to the theories of new-dialect formation to better understand why the linguistic features discussed in the following chap- ters have the shape that they do. Changes in the ethnolinguistic composition of the English-speaking population of Canada, especially in its largest cities, have been argued to have consequences for the future of Canadian English, a question we will explore in Chapter 7.

Lexical Variation
4.0 INTRODUCTION
4
 The previous chapter focused on the language-external considerations that led to the origins and development of Canadian English. We began by look- ing at how English spread around the world and the principles involved in the formation of new dialects before outlining the historical events that led to the establishment of the English-speaking communities in Canada and then using the principles of new dialect formation to explain the shape that the dialects spoken in these communities have taken. We also considered the role that ideology and language attitudes played in the formation of new norms and standards.
In this and in the next few chapters, we focus on the linguistic character- istics of Canadian English, although we will sometimes need to appeal to language-external considerations to explain the development of these features. Each chapter deals with a different component of the linguistic system: words (lexical features), sounds (phonetic and phonological features) and grammar (morphological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic features).
This chapter focuses on the lexical features of Canadian English, not only how the vocabulary of Canadian English differs from that of other dialects, but also how Canadian English varies from region to region. I begin by defin- ing what we mean by basic concepts such as word and lexicon, and I distin- guish these concepts from the more commonly understood terms, such as dictionaries. In order to understand the lexical features of Canadian English, it is necessary to first outline the regional structure of the English lexicon, distinguishing between the common lexical heritage shared by all English dia- lects (which results from the processes of transmission and diffusion discussed in the previous chapter) and dialectal innovation through processes such as borrowing from other languages, coining new words and developing new

62 LEXICALVARIATION
 meanings for old words. This discussion leads to a comparison of the lexical features of North American English with those of other dialects, the lexical fea- tures that distinguish Canadian English from American English and regional distinctions within Canadian English. In each of these sections, in addition to using the results of dialect surveys conducted in North America, I will also briefly discuss dictionaries of Canadian English and regional dictionaries.
4.1 LEXICONVS.DICTIONARY
Words are the most noticeable part of language. When people talk about lan- guage, they tend to focus on words. Public discussions about language in the media are often concerned with figuring out the “correct” meaning, spelling or usage of particular words. But what is a word? This question might seem silly—English speakers have an intuitive notion of how to recognize words (some might say that they’re separated by a space, but this is a convention of writing—we don’t separate each word when speaking). However, as we saw in the previous chapter, dialect is also an intuitive notion that becomes problem- atic once we examine it more closely.
We could define a word as a pairing of sound and meaning. However, as we saw in Chapter 2, words can be broken down into smaller units (morphemes) that also link sound and meaning. One difference between words and mor- phemes is that words can stand on their own, while morphemes may or may not (i.e. a word necessarily consists of at least one morpheme, but a single morpheme is not necessarily a word). We could then define a word as the smallest pairing of sound and meaning that can stand on its own.
As I mentioned in Chapter 2, Ferdinand de Saussure identified the link between sound and meaning in language as arbitrary: there’s no reason why a particular string of sounds should correspond to a particular meaning. This is one of the key ways in which languages differ from each other, and a large part of learning a language (whether it’s your first, second or fifth language) is memorizing the meanings of different strings of sounds. But if the link between sound and meaning is arbitrary, how do we know what the link is? Saussure also pointed out that sound–meaning correspondences are conventional: all speakers of a language agree on the meaning of each string of sounds. How- ever, I should point out that the sound–meaning link is not completely con- ventional. Speakers of the same language will often differ on the meaning of a particular word. New words can also be added to a language, and the meaning of words can change, sometimes in quite drastic ways (as any modern English speaker who has read Shakespeare or Chaucer may have noticed).
If part of learning a language is memorizing all the sound–meaning cor- respondences, part of the linguistic system must involve storing this informa- tion. Although there is some disagreement about the exact shape and content

LEXICAL VARIATION 63
 of each speaker’s lexical storage (the mental lexicon), most linguists would agree that each word or morpheme (or lexeme, to use a more general term) minimally includes all information that is not predictable from other, more productive processes. So, the entry for each lexeme should not only include its phonological form and its meaning, but also its syntactic category (noun, verb, adjective and so on) and any of its irregularities (such as irregular or suppletive past tense or plural forms).
So far we have been talking about the mental lexicon of individual speak- ers, but what does it mean to talk about the English lexicon? Since it’s unlikely that any English speaker knows every English word, the English lexicon must be bigger than the mental lexicon of the individual speaker. How do we recon- cile these two views? Rather than thinking of a lexicon as a well-defined, self- contained object, it might be better to think of it as a network: some (most?) lexemes are shared by all speakers (basic vocabulary), but some speakers, such as those in different geographical regions or in specialized fields of work, know lexemes that are unfamiliar to other speakers or use lexemes with slightly dif- ferent meanings. Also, since it is easy for speakers to learn new words (either explicitly or by inferring the meaning of a word from its usage in context), an individual’s mental lexicon can change across their lifespan. This view of the lexicon not only allows us to account for regional differences in vocabulary, but it also helps to explain how words change.
Linguists use the term lexicon to refer to the stored words of the English lan- guage, but most English speakers are probably more accustomed to thinking of dictionaries as the repository of English words. However, the respect for the authority of dictionaries is a consequence of recent traditions of widespread literacy and prescriptivism in European societies over the last few centuries. Dictionaries are concerned with considerations of sound (pronunciation) and meaning, but they also address questions of writing and spelling (orthogra- phy) that are not relevant to the spoken language. Words existed long before writing was invented, and written language existed for a long time before any- one felt the need to list all the words in their language. The earliest dictionaries that we know of had quite different purposes than those that we use nowa- days. They consisted of lists of corresponding words in different languages to be used for translation or administration in societies where many languages were spoken. The first English dictionaries that appeared in the 16th and 17th centuries were intended as an aid to translation from other languages, and the first known monolingual English dictionary (Robert Cawdrey’s [1604] A Table Alphabeticall) only included “difficult” words that would have been unfamiliar or obscure to most readers.
The type of dictionary that we are most familiar with today, which aims to provide a comprehensive list of words and includes detailed information about meanings, spellings and sometimes the origins and histories of words

64 LEXICALVARIATION
 (etymology) only appeared in the 18th century, when the modern profes- sion of dictionary-making, or lexicography, began. Samuel Johnson’s (1755) A Dictionary of the English Language was the first attempt to be comprehen- sive, as well as to provide a guide to pronunciation and meaning. Noah Web- ster’s (1828) An American Dictionary of the English Language, which not only included words not used in Britain but also initiated or promoted a number of spelling reforms that are used in American English until this day, was, in part, a patriotic attempt to differentiate American English from its British origins. Probably the most comprehensive English dictionary is the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), which was begun in 1884 under the editorship of James Murray, and the first edition of which was not completed until 1928. The OED was established on “historical principles”, in which each word is traced to its first appearance in print. Nowadays there are updated versions of Webster’s dictionary and the OED, as well as numerous other English dictionaries, not only those that aim to be comprehensive, but also those for regional, national or specialized vocabulary.
Dictionaries have two different purposes. Johnson’s and Webster’s dic- tionaries were intended, in part, as normative or prescriptive dictionaries, to instruct readers in the correct meaning, spelling and usage of words, and to prevent the language from changing. Part of the socialization involved in edu- cation in the English-speaking world includes an inculcation of a prescriptivist ideology of language, with an appeal to dictionaries as arbiters of correctness. More recently, dictionaries have taken on a descriptive purpose, document- ing the different pronunciations, spellings, meanings and usages of each word without indicating correctness. While their purpose is not to prescribe stan- dards, some descriptive dictionaries provide guidelines for accepted usage.
4.2 CANADIANISMS
In the previous section, I suggested that the English lexicon is best viewed as a network of individual mental lexicons. If we look at this network regionally, all varieties of English share a common core vocabulary but differ from each other because of innovations that have taken place in each variety since their divergence from each other. The regional structure of the English lexicon can be visualized as in Figure 4.1.
At the highest level, all varieties of English share lexemes inherited from their common origin, as a result of the process of language transmission that we discussed in the previous chapter (as indicated by the solid lines). These lexemes include the basic vocabulary of English that developed out of its Anglo-Saxon roots and was augmented by influence and borrowing from French and Scandinavian languages. In the process of spreading through the world, different regional varieties developed and innovated in different ways.

  The establishment of the English-speaking communities outside of Britain took place at a time when intercontinental travel and communication were very slow. For example, in the 17th century it could take up to two months to travel just from Britain to the east coast of North America, and the First Fleet took eight months to travel to Australia in 1787–88. In the absence of tele- communication (telegraphs, telephones, radio and so on), news only travels as quickly as the fastest ship. These distances meant that the regular interaction among speakers needed to maintain community speech conventions became weakened, and different varieties of English became free to innovate. Given the encounters with new cultures and unknown flora and fauna, an obvious source of new words in new English dialects was the wholesale importation from other languages, or lexical borrowing. While English already had a long history of borrowing—from Latin, French and the Scandinavian languages— English speakers in each of the new communities were exposed to different lan- guages, leading to new English words such as boss, cookie, canoe and boomerang (see below). New words are also coined by combining words or morphemes that already exist in the language (through affixation and compounding), such as skyscraper or telephone. Words are sometimes invented from scratch (neolo- gisms), such as blurb and xerox. Such innovations led to increasing differences in the lexicons of the new varieties of English that developed in the 17th to 19th centuries and gave rise to lexical regionalisms (Americanisms, Canadi- anisms, Australianisms and so on).
Yet words are easily acquired. As transportation and communication within the English-speaking world became faster, there was increasing contact between English varieties. Through the process of diffusion discussed in the preceding chapter, lexical innovations in one variety could spread to another, potentially obscuring regional differences. So unless we know the history of a particular word, it may be difficult to determine its origin.
These considerations mean that deciding whether a particular English word should be considered a regionalism may be made in several ways. First, a word

66 LEXICALVARIATION
 may be considered a regionalism if it originated in a particular region, regard- less of whether it is now used elsewhere. The word boomerang clearly origi- nated in Australia (borrowed from aboriginal languages spoken in New South Wales), yet most English speakers know this word. Second, a word may be con- sidered a regionalism if it has unique occurrence in a particular region, even if it originated elsewhere. For example, the Canadian English word riding (“a voting district”) originated in Britain but is no longer used there. Third, a word may be considered a regionalism if it has a unique meaning in one region. For example, among the meanings of root in Australian English is a slang term for “copulate”, a meaning it does not have in other English varieties. Finally, we can appeal to considerations of frequency: different words for the same thing coexist in many English-speaking communities, but if a word is more frequent in a particular region, it may be considered a regionalism (as we will see below).
As Figure 4.1 shows, regionalisms are not the same as national boundaries. Canadian and American English share a number of terms that can be classed as North Americanisms, as they are either only used in North America or are used with meanings that differ from other varieties of English. Canadians and Americans put gas rather than petrol in their cars, they drive a truck rather than a lorry and parents push their baby in a carriage rather than in a pram. The words yard and garden have opposite meanings in North America and Britain: in Britain, a garden is larger than a yard, but in North America the reverse is true. In North America, to be pissed (or pissed off ) means to be angry, while in Britain it means to be drunk. To knock up someone in North America is to get her pregnant, while in Britain it means to wake someone up.
Both American and Canadian English feature words originally borrowed from other languages, such as boss and cookie from Dutch and canoe from Carib via Spanish. Canadian English has borrowed further from the languages spoken by other people who played a major role in founding and settling the country. From French come aboiteau (an Acadian term referring to a tech- nique for farming on marshland), coureur de bois (a fur trapper or trader), dépanneur (or dep, a convenience store) and touque, a knitted hat. From the First Nations languages come moccasin (a leather shoe) from Algonquian, pemmican (a mixture of fat, berries and meat) from Cree and kayak (a small covered boat propelled with a paddle) from Inuktitut.
Canadian English also features a number of neologisms, words either blended from other elements or invented from scratch. For example, a native speaker of English is referred to as an anglophone and a native French speaker as a francophone, while someone whose first language is something other than French or English is an allophone. A Canadian is often referred to by the term Canuck, the origin of which is unclear, but it seems to have originally been an American term used to refer to a French Canadian. As in other English- speaking political contexts, members of the Conservative party are referred

LEXICAL VARIATION 67
 to as Tories, but in Canada members of the Liberal parties are Grits. Canadian meteorologists use the term humidex (a blend of humidity and index) to describe how hot it feels once you factor the humidity into the heat. More recent neolo- gisms include loonie, an informal term for the one-dollar coin introduced in 1987 (because of the loon depicted on the tail side of the coin) and toonie, a blend of two and loonie, which refers to the two-dollar coin introduced in 1996. Another recent neologism is grow op (or grow-op), a clipping of grow opportunity (or grow operation), which refers to an illegal marijuana cultivation operation.
A number of words that occur elsewhere in the English-speaking world have distinctive usages in Canadian English. A voting district is referred to as a riding, a Canadian will ask to use the washroom rather than the restroom, a single-room apartment is referred to as a bachelor apartment, First Nations people may live on an Indian reserve, Canadians use a serviette rather than a napkin, they eat with cutlery rather than utensils and they will tend to stand in a line up rather than a line or a queue. One of the most distinctive unique usages in Canadian English is the term chesterfield, which refers to a piece of furniture that is otherwise called a couch or sofa.
Perhaps because of the extent to which English Canada looked toward for- eign standards of linguistic behaviour—British or American—dictionaries of Canadian English are relatively recent. As with the earliest English dictionar- ies, Canadian English was first recognized as a separate variety in a bilingual dictionary, Nugent’s Up-to-Date English-French and French-English Dictionary, published in 1905 by Sylva Clapin, who had already published A New Diction- ary of American-isms: Being a Glossary of Words Supposed to be Peculiar to the United States and the Dominion of Canada (1902). Throughout the 20th cen- tury there were a number of dictionaries produced for the Canadian market, but they tended to be specialized or reduced versions of American dictionar- ies, such as the Winston Simplified Dictionary for Canadian Schools (Brown and Alexander 1937), based on the American Winston Simplified Dictionary (1919). The first stand-alone monolingual dictionary of Canadian English was John Sandilands’s (1912) Western Canadian Dictionary and Phrase Book, although it was primarily intended as a guide for new arrivals to the western territories to understand some of the local turns of phrase. However, it has been pointed out that the aim of this dictionary was not to provide a comprehensive account of western Canadian English, and that many of the words and phrases recorded by Sandilands were not unique to Canadian English but were also used in the United States.
It was not until the foundation of the Canadian Linguistic Association in 1954 that serious consideration was given to developing a comprehensive dic- tionary of Canadian English on the same principles of the OED. The first vol- ume of the Dictionary of Canadian English (Avis 1962) was followed by the more detailed Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles (Avis 1967).

68 LEXICALVARIATION
 In the 1990s, other dictionaries of Canadian English appeared, such as the ITP Nelson Canadian Dictionary of the English Language (ITP Nelson 1996) and the Canadian Oxford Dictionary (Barber 1998), along with regional dictionar- ies of Newfoundland English (Story, Kirwin and Widdowson 1982) and Prince Edward Island English (Pratt 1988).
Apart from regionalisms, another concern of Canadian English lexicogra- phy is the issue of orthography, or spelling. Up until the 18th century there was a great deal of variation in English spelling, with writers (and, later, print- ers) spelling words according to how they themselves pronounced them and/ or introducing their own idiosyncrasies into their spelling. One of the goals of Johnson’s dictionary was to standardize spelling so that anyone could rec- ognize a word on the basis of its spelling no matter how they pronounced it. As noted in Chapter 3, although Canada was a British colony, its geographic proximity to the United States meant that schoolteachers and the textbooks they used tended to be American more than British. As a result, Canadian English has always been torn between the British spelling standards of its for- mer mother country and the American spelling standards of its nearer and larger neighbour. This conflict has resulted in a compromise situation in which a great deal of variation is tolerated. However, for some words there is a clear preference for British spelling (harbour instead of harbor, centre instead of center, cheque instead of check) and for others for American spelling (curb for kerb, tire for tyre, jail for gaol).
4.3 STUDYINGREGIONALVARIATION
While lexicography seeks to collect and define all the words of a language, the goal of dialectology is to understand how language differs from place to place. The interest in dialect differences developed during the 18th and 19th centu- ries, when processes of state formation and centralization, along with codifi- cation and standardization of language, led to concerns that regional dialects needed to be documented before they disappeared. This concern for dialect preservation was part of the Romantic movement of the same period, which viewed the culture and language of the countryside as embodying the national character.
Dialectology differs from lexicography not only in its goals but also in its methods of data collection. Rather than documenting the lexicon through written documents, dialectology is concerned with collecting words as they are actually used by speakers of the language. To this end, dialectology tends to make use of techniques of elicitation. In order to ensure that the results for each speaker will be comparable, dialectologists have tended to make use of dialect questionnaires that contain a list of questions concerning words of specific interest.

LEXICAL VARIATION 69
 Dialect surveys have made use of different types of questions, depending on the kind of data they want to elicit. Questions can be open ended, such as “What do you call the shoes you wear to play sports?” (or “What do you call this?” with a picture of the shoe), or they can be closed, so that the respon- dent has to choose from a list, such as: “(a) running shoes, (b) runners, (c) sneakers”.
Data can also be elicited in different ways depending on the type of data required as well as the degree of literacy of the respondents. In the earliest dialect survey (1876–86), Georg Wenker mailed a questionnaire containing questions about local dialect forms to schoolmasters at thousands of locations around Germany. In Jules Gilliéron’s dialect survey of France (1896–1900), his fieldworker Edmond Edmont traveled the country administering the ques- tionnaire and recording responses. In addition to postal surveys and fieldwork surveys, recent dialect surveys have made use of the telephone and the Internet to administer questionnaires to potential respondents.
Since the goal of dialectology is to understand regional differences in lan- guage, the responses to each question are normally recorded by indicating the variant used and the location of the response on a map. When multiple responses are recorded, we begin to see patterns of regional distribution. Figure 4.2 shows a hypothetical result from a dialect survey, distinguishing between two lexical variants (indicated by triangles and circles). If we have a good representation of locations, we can draw an isogloss on the map, a line that separates two geographic regions in which different variants are used.
Normally we want to take into consideration more than one isogloss, to look for places where isoglosses coincide. Bundling of isoglosses gives us con- fidence in claiming the existence of a dialect area.

Figure 4.3 shows a famous bundle of isoglosses that cuts across northern Germany. To the north, speakers pronounce the words ich (“I”), machen (“make”, “do”), Dorf (“village”) and das (“the [neuter]”) as [ik], [makən], [dorp] and [dat], respectively (with stops), while to the south, these words are pronounced as [ix], [maxən], [dorf] and [das] (with fricatives). Although as they approach the river Rhine these isoglosses begin to spread out (the so-called “Rhenish fan”), the bundling of these isoglosses over most of their length is taken to define the boundary between northern (Low) German and southern (High) German.
Large-scale surveys of North American English were undertaken in the first half of the 20th century, but their treatment of Canadian English was mainly incidental. The first Survey of Canadian English (another goal at the foun- dation of the Canadian Linguistic Association) was only published in 1972 (Scargill and Warkentyne 1972), followed by regional surveys in locales such as Vancouver (Gregg 1992) and Ottawa (Woods 1979). These surveys revealed regional differences in the choice of Canadianisms as well as a tendency for younger speakers to increase their use of Americanisms.
In contrast with traditional dialect geography, which is concerned with mapping regional variation, dialect topography (Chambers 1998a) also takes

into account the distribution of lexical variants within each region according to social characteristics. For example, by incorporating speaker age as a factor, we can infer the existence of ongoing lexical change.
J. K. Chambers’s Dialect Topography Project, conducted in the 1990s, covered seven English-speaking regions of Canada, shown in Figure 4.4: the “Golden Horseshoe” (the western end of Lake Ontario, stretching from Toronto’s east- ern suburbs to the Niagara region), the Ottawa Valley, Montreal, Quebec City, the Eastern Townships, New Brunswick and (on the west coast) Vancouver. Using a questionnaire (first distributed in hard copy by mail, later collected online), he asked 11 personal data questions and 76 questions about linguis- tic variables, with open-ended responses. For example, Figure 4.5 shows the regional distribution of words for athletic footwear (sneakers, running shoes and runners) across the different English-speaking regions of Canada, as well as two border regions in New York State. Although all three terms can be found in each region of Canada, and two can be found in at least one of the US regions, there is a clear preference for one variant (running shoes) across all regions of Canada and for another (sneakers) in both US regions. So we are justified in viewing running shoes as a Canadianism.
Chambers’s survey also asked respondents questions about their social characteristics. In Figure 4.6, which shows the distribution by both region and age for the use of snuck (vs. sneaked) as a past tense of the verb sneak,

there is a clear correlation between the use of this variant and the respon- dent’s age: the younger the respondent, the more likely they are to prefer snuck. This correlation, which holds regardless of region, suggests that a change has taken place in Canadian English for this lexical item within the last few generations.

Source: Boberg 2005.
Charles Boberg’s (2005) more recent North American Regional Vocabulary Survey (NARVS) collected responses from a written questionnaire consisting of 53 questions covering most of the English-speaking regions of Canada. In addition to each of the nine provinces other than Quebec, the major met- ropolitan areas (Vancouver-Victoria, Toronto and Montreal) were consid- ered separately, and, as the largest and most populous province, Ontario was divided into northern, eastern and southern regions (see Figure 4.7).
Rather than determining isoglosses on the basis of individual lexical vari- ants, Boberg (2005) uses two aggregate measurements of differences between regions: net variation, which sums all the differences in percentages for each vari- ant between each region, and major isoglosses, which takes as meaningful any dif- ference of 50% or more in percentage for each variable between regions. Table 4.1 shows a comparison of each region with its immediate neighbour, in terms of both net variation and major isoglosses, for 44 lexical variables in NARVS. The greatest distinction is between Montreal (MR) and its neighbours: not only does it feature the highest net variation (62–54%) but also the most major isoglosses (17–9). The next highest distinction is between Newfoundland (NL) and its immedi- ate neighbours (45–44% net variation and 8–5 major isoglosses). The remain- ing differences between regions begin to show some disagreement between net variation and major isoglosses, but there do seem to be differences that suggest a western dialect region (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) and a Maritime dialect region (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island), with Ontario forming its own dialect region. Table 4.2 provides the top 10 words that differentiate between these regions (note that the numbers in Table 4.2

No Canadian region stands out as being more “American” than any other region by either measure, though the differences seem to be smallest for the largest cities (Toronto and Vancouver), which might suggest a relationship between urban centres and (the perception of) Americanization.
SUMMARY
This chapter focused on variation in the lexicon of Canadian English, not only its differences from other varieties of English but also regional differ- ences within Canada. We began by defining basic linguistic concepts such as “lexeme” and “lexicon”, distinguishing them from the ordinary understand- ing of word and dictionary. We can think of the English lexicon as a network of lexicons distinguished on the one hand by elements of common heritage and on the other by regional differences that result from processes of borrow- ing, innovation and semantic shift. Lexicography concerns the description of lexicons through dictionaries, either prescriptive or descriptive, while dialect surveys concern the geographic distribution of linguistic variation and the development of dialect maps. An additional dimension to the study of lexi- cal variation is provided by dialect topography, which concerns not only geo- graphic distribution but also the social factors that condition lexical choice.

5 Phonetic and Phonological Variation
5.1 INTRODUCTION
In the previous chapter, we discussed the lexical features of Canadian English, examining their similarities with those of other varieties of English due to their common inheritance through processes such as transmission and diffusion, as well as dialectal differences and regionalisms that arose from different strategies of lexical innovation, such as borrowing, semantic shift and neologism.
In this chapter, we turn to the sound system of Canadian English; that is, the organization of the phonological system into phonemic distinctions and their phonetic realizations. As we did with lexical features, we can explain some of the phonological and phonetic similarities of Canadian English with other varieties of English through the common inheritance from Britain and from the Loyalist Americans. However, lexical features and phonological features dif- fer in a couple of respects. While words are easily acquired throughout life and easily spread from variety to variety through diffusion, phonemes and their phonetic realization are more resistant to change across the lifespan of an indi- vidual and are much harder to acquire in adulthood (as anyone who has tried to learn another language as an adult knows). In addition, while lexical borrowing and innovation are common processes, the borrowing and innovation of pho- nological distinctions or phonetic realizations are much rarer. Because of these differences between lexical and phonological features, any divergence in the phonological system between Canadian English and other varieties of English requires recourse to explanations other than innovation and borrowing.
When people speak of the Canadian “accent”, they often note that it is remarkably homogeneous across the country, without the sharp regional dif- ferences that characterize the English spoken in Britain, or even in the United States. However, this generalization really only applies to the Canadian English that is spoken in the area stretching from eastern Ontario to Vancouver Island

 in the west. In this chapter, I will refer to this variety as General Canadian English (GCE). This variety encompasses most of the country and the majority of its English-speaking population, but there are audible differences between GCE and the varieties spoken in other regions, such as the province of Quebec (primarily Montreal, though there are other English-speaking communities throughout the province), the Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, New Bruns- wick and Prince Edward Island) and Newfoundland. As we will see, there may also be regional differences within GCE that are not easily audible but may be revealed through more detailed phonetic and sociolinguistic analysis.
In this chapter, I will begin by discussing the phonological and phonetic features of GCE, focusing on those consonant and vowel features that distin- guish the Canadian English accent from other English accents. I will discuss some of the issues involved in studying regional variation in phonology and phonetics (and how they differ from studying lexical variation) before I con- sider regional variation in Canadian English sound systems.
5.2 PHONOLOGICALFEATURESOFGENERAL CANADIAN ENGLISH
5.2.1 Consonants
Varieties of English do not greatly differ from each other in their inventory of consonant phonemes, but they do sometimes differ in the way these pho- nemes are realized phonetically. As Table 5.1 shows, the phonemic inventory of consonants for GCE is largely the same as that of other varieties of English, but some of these phonemes exhibit additional phonetic variation according to social and stylistic considerations. The interdental consonants, as in thing and there, are normally realized as the voiced and voiceless fricatives [θ] and [ð], respectively. The voiced phoneme /ð/ sometimes occurs as a stopped [d] in casual contexts (“th-stopping”), especially in function words like the, and more commonly in the speech of rural or working-class speakers and urban speakers of different ethnic backgrounds. The coronal stops /t/ and /d/ occur as a voiced flap or tap [ɾ] when they are preceded by a stressed vowel and followed by another vowel or a syllabic sonorant ([l̩ ], [ɹ̩ ] or [n̩ ]), as in potato [phəˈthejɾow] or ladder [ˈlæɾɹ̩ ]. In GCE, as in General American English, /l/ after a vowel or in its syllabic form is realized as a “dark” or velar [ɫ], as opposed to a clear [l], as in milk [mɪɫk], and /r/, which is realized as a retroflex approximant [ɹ], is always pronounced after vowels and as a syllabic nucleus, as in north [nɔɹθ] and nurse [nɹs]. Thus, GCE is a rhotic variety of English.
As noted, consonant phonemes exhibit some variation in their phonetic realization. Coronal stops followed by the diphthong [ju], such as tune and

 dune, are normally palatalized as [tjuwn] and [djuwn], but some speakers drop the palatal articulation (“yod-dropping”) so that tune sounds like [thuwn], or they combine the coronal stop and the palatal into a palato-alveolar affricate (“yod-coalescence”), so that tune is pronounced as [tʃuwn]). While speakers of GCE currently do not distinguish between voiced [w] and voiceless [ʍ] in words such as what, it was reported in the past among older speakers (e.g. I heard it in the speech of my maternal grandfather, a Canadian of Irish back- ground who grew up in the Ottawa Valley in the early 20th century). However, Sali Tagliamonte (personal communication) has noted its current use in data she has collected in northern Ontario.
5.2.2 Vowels
Unlike differences in the phonemic organization of consonants, the phone- mics of vowel systems serve to distinguish among varieties of English. As we saw in Chapter 2, while the production of consonants is relatively discrete, production of vowels is continuous in two dimensions: height and backness/ frontness. In theory, a virtually infinite number of divisions of the vowel space into phonemic distinctions is possible. But the continuous nature of vowel production, in which the space of neighbouring vowels can potentially over- lap with each other, is at odds with the phonemic imperative to maximize the distinction between contrastive sounds.
As with consonants, varieties of English may share the same inventory of vowel phonemes but differ in how those phonemes are realized phonetically. For example, the English phoneme /o/ as in coat is realized in North Ameri- can English as [ow] but in Australian English as [əʉ]. The vowel phonemes of different varieties may also be distinguished by their phonemic incidence, the distribution of allophones according to elements of the linguistic context. For example, some varieties of English make a distinction in low vowels before fricatives and nasals, such that trap and bath (and dance) have different pho- netic realizations in British English ([æ] and [ɑː]), but not in North American English.
More crucially, phonemic vowel systems of English varieties are distinguished by their inventories of phonemic contrasts. Because the phonetic realization of a vowel is never exactly the same, it is more accurate to think of vowel phonemes as occupying an area of the vowel space than as discrete points. If the area of one vowel begins to overlap with that of another vowel, two vowel phonemes may end up becoming merged as one phoneme. For example, the reason that meet and meat are spelled differently but pronounced the same is that the Early Modern English /ɛ:/ vowel (spelled as ea) merged with the /e:/ vowel (spelled as ee) (Wells 1982). Alternatively, the area occupied by the other vowel may move away in order to maintain the phonemic contrast, encroaching on the area of another

vowel, which itself may move away, and so on, resulting in a chain shift. For example, the Great English Vowel Shift, which took place in the 15th and 16th centuries, involved a shift of the long vowels along the path /a:/  /e:/  /i:/  / ay/ (e.g. mate to [me:t], meet (and meat) to [mi:t], mite to [mayt], which explains why the English pronunciation of vowel letters is at odds with their pronuncia- tion in other European languages). Less common but also possible is a split of two phonemes, in which different parts of a vowel’s area begin to separate until they end up becoming two phonemes. While dialects of English have probably always been characterized by diversity in their phonemic inventory of vowels, the operation of mergers, shifts and splits in the centuries since the spread and diversification of English (see Chapter 3) has acted to reorganize the vowel sys- tems of English varieties in different ways.
In the phonemic vowel inventory of GCE presented in Table 5.2 there are three main features distinguishing it from other varieties of English, one involving a vowel merger, one involving phonemic incidence and another involving a vowel shift.
The Low-Back Merger
Canadian English is distinguished from many other English vowel systems by the complete merger of the low and low-back vowels /ɑ/, /ɒ/ and /ɔ/ (in terms of Wells’s [1982] lexical sets, the palm, lot and thought vowels), which are all realized phonetically as [ɑ]. This merger, sometimes referred to as the cot/caught merger, seems to be a continuation of the reorganization of the low-back vowels that began in Early Modern English. Another feature of low vowels that helps to distinguish GCE from American English is whether foreign loanwords such as drama and pasta are adapted to English as either /æ/ or /ɑ/. GCE prefers adaptation to /æ/, such that pasta is pronounced as [phæstə].
u mid ɛ ʌ e o lowæ ɑ
 
82 PHONETICANDPHONOLOGICALVARIATION
 Canadian Raising
Perhaps the most salient feature of GCE is the raising of the onset of the diphthongs /ay/ and /aw/ before voiceless consonants, leading to differ- ent pronunciations of the vowels in prize [prayz] versus price [prəys] and house (verb) [hawz] versus house (noun) [həws]. (See Figure 2.3 on p. 12.) This difference leads Americans to believe that they’re hearing Canadians say out and about as oot and aboot. This feature of GCE was first identified by Martin Joos in 1942 and was labeled by J. K. Chambers (1973/1975) as Canadian Raising. Using the notation of phonological rules prevalent at the time, he formulated the rule of Canadian Raising, as in (5.1).
(5.1) V  −low /__ GLIDE C [][][]
+tense −voice
As Chambers notes, the label “Canadian” is a bit misleading, since raised realizations of these diphthongs occur in some varieties of English in the United States and the British Isles. What may be unique to Canadian English is the phonemic incidence of the raising (only before voiceless consonants), which Peter Trudgill (1986, 2006) argues to have come about as a result of the processes involved in dialect leveling that took place during the development of GCE in Upper Canada in the mid-19th century (see p. 40). As we saw in Chap- ter 3, the input to this variety included American Loyalist English, in which the onset of the diphthongs was not raised, and other varieties of English in which the onset of the diphthongs was always raised (northern English and Irish and, most notably, Scottish immigrants). Although the Loyalists con- stituted the founding population of English-speaking Canada, throughout the 19th century their numbers were overwhelmed by British immigration, predominantly from northern Britain and from Ireland. Under Trudgill’s account, a situation in which the two variants (raised and nonraised onsets) were originally interpreted as regional became structurally reallocated to different linguistic contexts: raised before voiceless consonants, unraised elsewhere. If Trudgill’s account of the origins of Canadian Raising is cor- rect, we should expect to find evidence for its existence by the end of the 19th century. Although we do not of course have recorded data from the time period in which the reallocation would have taken place, we do have indirect evidence. In 1991 Erik Thomas analyzed data collected in the 1940s and 1950s as part of a dialectological survey of the United States that included informants in Ontario who had been born in the late 19th century. Thomas assigned each respondent an index score, with a higher score indi- cating more raising, and mapped the geographical distribution of the scores for /aw/ and /ay/, as shown in Figures 5.1 and 5.2, respectively. Although

the scores on the Ontario side of the border vary a great deal (between 1.14 for /aw/ in Cornwall to 5.05 for /aw/ in Belleville), they are consistently higher than those on the American side of the border. If we assume that the respondents had acquired their phonological systems in childhood and early
 
84 PHONETICANDPHONOLOGICALVARIATION
 adolescence (see Chapter 7), this distribution would suggest that Canadian Raising was already established as a feature of Canadian English around the time of Confederation.
The Canadian Vowel Shift
As noted above, the vowel systems of English varieties that developed as the language spread and diversified over the last few centuries have been distin- guished by the different vowel mergers, shifts and splits that have taken place in each. William Labov (1991) has identified three dialects of English based on the mergers and shifts taking place in North American English. The first dialect is undergoing the Northern Cities Shift (NCS), which primarily occurs in northern US cities such as Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo (New York), Detroit (Michigan) and Chicago (Illinois). The NCS involves the fronting of /a/ to [æ] and the raising of /æ/ to [ɛ], among other components shown in Figure 5.3. The second dialect, which encompasses the southeastern United States, is undergoing the Southern Shift. As shown in Figure 5.4, the Southern Shift involves the merger of the vowels in pin and pen and the monophthongi- zation of /ay/ to [a:], among other features. Labov characterizes the third dia- lect, which encompasses the remainder of English-speaking North America, by the absence of vowel shifts.
However, in a 1995 study, Sandra Clarke and her associates provided the first evidence for an ongoing shift in the vowel system of Canadian English,
                      FIGURE 5.3 The Northern Cities Shift

PHONETIC AND PHONOLOGICAL VARIATION 85
 which they called the Canadian Vowel Shift (CVS). As illustrated in Figure 5.5, the CVS involves the retraction and lowering of the front lax vowels /ɪ/, /ɛ/ and /æ/, along with the lowering of /ʌ/ and /ʊ/. Clarke and her associates argue that the CVS is a chain shift, initially triggered by the cot/caught merger, which

 created a space into which /æ/ could move, which, in turn, created a space for /ɛ/ to retract and lower, which in turn led to the lowering of /ɪ/. This sequence of components of the shift received some support from the rela- tive frequency of each component, with older components such as /æ/- retraction featuring higher rates of occurrence than newer components such as /ɪ/-lowering. Canadian English is also characterized by the fronting of /u/, but it’s not clear whether this is part of the CVS or an independent development.
5.3 REGIONALVARIATION 5.3.1 StudyingPhoneticandPhonologicalVariation
As with lexical variation (see Chapter 4), variation in phonetic and phonologi- cal dialect features can be studied using surveys or questionnaires. In design- ing questions to elicit phonetic variants, it is important to remember that most people do not have any training in distinguishing phonetic detail or in phonetic transcription. If the questionnaire is not administered in person, so that responses can be transcribed by a trained phonetician, questions must be framed in such a way that the relevant phonetic distinctions can be inferred from responses. For example, to elicit variants in the pronunciation of the vowel in the word soot ([u] or [ʊ]), J.K. Chambers asked his respondents the question in (5.2).
(5.2) Does SOOT (as in “chimney soot”) rhyme with FOOT or BOOT?
If the questionnaire is administered in person, responses can not only be transcribed phonetically but audio-recorded for later analysis. In this case, rather than asking questions to elicit lexical items or rhyming judgments, it is more efficient to present the informant with a printed list of words to read, and then audio-record them as they read the list. Using a word list ensures that you obtain a sufficient amount of data from each informant, and that the phonetic environment is controlled for effects of surrounding sounds on the phonetic realization of the feature of interest. Word lists have a couple of disadvantages. If the informants have limited or no literacy, ask- ing them to read a list of words may be embarrassing or challenging. Also, since reading a list of words is a highly unusual type of activity, the pronun- ciations elicited may not resemble the informant’s behaviour in conversa- tional interaction.
In order to overcome the unnaturalness involved in eliciting language data for phonetic and phonological analysis, other approaches have been used to approximate conversational interaction. As William Labov (1984)

 created a space into which /æ/ could move, which, in turn, created a space for /ɛ/ to retract and lower, which in turn led to the lowering of /ɪ/. This sequence of components of the shift received some support from the rela- tive frequency of each component, with older components such as /æ/- retraction featuring higher rates of occurrence than newer components such as /ɪ/-lowering. Canadian English is also characterized by the fronting of /u/, but it’s not clear whether this is part of the CVS or an independent development.

In order to overcome the unnaturalness involved in eliciting language data for phonetic and phonological analysis, other approaches have been used to approximate conversational interaction. As William Labov (1984)

PHONETIC AND PHONOLOGICAL VARIATION 87
 has noted, collecting sociolinguistic data involves two potentially conflicting goals: on the one hand, we want to collect data from a large, representative sample of the population we are studying; on the other hand, we want to collect data that is as close as possible to the way people speak when they are not being studied. Since most people command a range of speaking styles (from informal to formal), putting them in a situation where they know you are studying their speech is likely to elicit a more formal style. As a result, studies following on Labov’s pioneering work in the 1960s have made use of the sociolinguistic interview, in which the researcher manipulates ele- ments of the speech event to focus attention on content (i.e. what’s being talked about) rather than on form (i.e. how it is being said). In conducting the sociolinguistic interview, the interviewer focuses on topics of interest to the informant—childhood games, neighbourhood life, memorable events, and so on. Most effective for the purposes of eliciting natural language data are narratives of personal experience, in which the informants become so caught up in retelling the story that they essentially relive the event (the most effective narratives, according to Labov, are those involving the danger of death). A sociolinguistic interview, which normally lasts between one and two hours, can provide dozens of realizations of the phonetic or phonologi- cal feature of interest. If the interviewer is successful in creating an informal context, the informant may approach the style of speaking that they nor- mally use in conversational interaction with friends and family. While the sociolinguistic interview offers the advantage of heightened naturalism in the analysis of phonetic and phonological variation, it does have its limita- tions. The feature of interest may arise sporadically (or never) in the inter- view, and when it does occur, there is no controlling the phonetic contexts in which it occurs. These considerations mean that it may be difficult to compare data across speakers or communities.
5.3.2 RegionalVariationinCanadianEnglish
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, the Canadian English accent is often characterized as remarkably homogeneous, not exhibiting the distinc- tive regional variation found in the United Kingdom or even in the United States (Chambers 1998b). However, this characterization is really only true for GCE, and undoubtedly stems from the fact that the English-speaking areas of central and western Canada were settled primarily from or through Upper Canada (Ontario), with the variety of English spoken there serving as the model for subsequent arrivals (under the founder principle). However, as we saw in Chapter 3, the English-speaking regions of eastern Canada have undergone rather different patterns of settlement and immigration, suggest- ing that there should be regional variety in Canadian English outside of GCE.

In addition, the characterization of GCE as homogeneous has until recently not been tested through large-scale sociophonetic analysis, which might reveal more complex patterns of social and linguistic conditioning not evident in more traditional methods of analysis.
A traditional view of the divisions of dialects within Canadian English within the context of North American English is shown in Figure 5.6 (adapted from Trudgill 2000): “General Canadian” is taken as stretching from the Ontario/Quebec border to the west coast, with Newfoundland (but not Lab- rador) and the Maritimes as two different dialect regions, and the province of Quebec excluded as a minority English-speaking region. Although this char- acterization of regional variation in Canadian English is becoming less tenable with ongoing work, I will take this as a starting point, examining each of these regions in turn, moving from east to west.
The regional variety of Canadian English that differs most markedly from GCE is undoubtedly Newfoundland and Labrador English (NLE; which includes not only the island of Newfoundland but the mainland part of the province), largely as a result of the province’s unique patterns of settlement (almost entirely from southeastern Ireland and southwestern England) and its geo- graphic isolation from the rest of the country (see Clarke 2010b; see Chapter 3). While the phonemic consonant inventory of NLE is not substantially differ- ent from that of GCE, the phonetic realization of consonants can vary quite a bit. In NLE, th-stopping is common, not only with the voiced phoneme /ð/ in function words, such as the and there, which occurs in some styles in other varieties of English, but also with the voiceless phoneme /θ/ more generally, so that the word three sounds like tree. In the Irish-settled parts of Newfoundland, the phoneme /l/ is realized as a clear [l] rather than the dark [ɫ] more common in

PHONETIC AND PHONOLOGICAL VARIATION 89
 North American English, and is sometimes vocalized to [w]. In the English- settled parts of Newfoundland, deletion of initial /h/ is common (e.g. ‘appy), which can also lead to h-insertion in words in which there is no etymologi- cal /h/ (e.g. h-early). Probably the most noticeable difference in consonants between NLE and GCE is the frequent realization of word-final /t/ with an affricated (or “slit”) variant.
The vowel system of NLE is complicated by the coexistence of several systems, ranging from a province-wide “standard” accent to accents associ- ated with regions of the province settled from Ireland and England. The pri- mary phonetic realizations of standard NLE for the different lexical classes are shown in Table 5.3 (adapted from the characterizations provided by Wells [1982] and Clarke [2010a]), in which additional phonetic variants are indicated through the use of commas or parentheses. In general, the NLE vowel system is distinguished from that of GCE in the realizations of the low and low-back

 vowels and the onsets of diphthongs and vowels before /r/. Both Canadian Raising (and fronting of the onset in /aw/) and the low-back vowel merger exist to varying degrees in different varieties of NLE, although the phonetic realization of the merged vowel is more fronted than in GCE, realized as [ɐ] or [a]. Vowels before /r/ in the start and north classes also tend to be more fronted, as [a] or even [æ], and the onsets of diphthongs in the choice and price classes vary between more central [ə] and more backed [ɔ] realizations (see Clarke [2010b] for a more thorough discussion of the regional and stylis- tic variation in NLE vowels).
Until recently (Boberg 2010; Labov, Ash and Boberg 2006; see below) there has not been as much attention paid to the phonetics of Maritime English (ME), the varieties of English spoken in the Atlantic provinces other than Newfoundland—Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. As in NLE, some varieties of ME (such as that spoken in the island of Cape Breton in Nova Scotia) show evidence of slit /t/. The palatalization of /s/ in consonant clusters with /tr/ and /kr/, so that street and scream begin with [ʃtɹ] and [ʃkɹ], respectively, has been noted in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The vowel systems of ME show a number of differences from both GCE and NLE (Kiefte and Kay-Raining Bird 2010). While there is evidence of the low-back vowel merger, its phonetic realization differs slightly from GCE, being rounder and more back, [ɒ̝ ] or [ɔ]. There is also little evidence for Canadian Raising in Maritime English: the onset of the diphthongs /ay/ and /aw/ tend to be realized in a more back and rounded form, as [ɒj] or [ɔw] (to my GCE ears, about in Nova Scotian English sounds like a boat). The low vowels in the start and trap classes tend to be fronted and somewhat raised and the face vowel is monophthongized.
Quebec English (QE) has until recently (see Boberg 2010 and below) also received little attention from phonetic analysis, presumably because the English-speaking population in this province constitutes a minority, as indi- cated in Figure 5.6, although this status belies the substantial number of Eng- lish speakers in Quebec. Most work on QE focuses on Montreal, home to the largest English-speaking community in the province. The historical pattern of English-speaking settlement in Montreal is different from that in Ontario, in that the founding population does not trace back to Loyalist migration but to immigration directly from the United Kingdom in the 19th century. Montreal is also home to substantial and long-standing Jewish and Italian communi- ties that shifted to English (see Chapter 7). Although not as substantial as in Montreal, there are other English-speaking communities in the province that can be traced back to the 1790s, notably the Eastern Townships (centred on the city of Sherbrooke) and in Quebec City.
As noted above, the majority of English-speaking Canada (in terms of both geography and population) is said to speak GCE, although this

generalization is normally restricted to “urban, middle-class anglophone Canadians” (Chambers 1998b:252). We might ask about the exact extent of the geographical range of GCE. We do not want to include the Atlantic prov- inces, but should QE be excluded, as in Figure 5.6? In the Atlas of North Amer- ican English (Labov, Ash and Boberg 2006), which included a small number of informants from the largest Canadian cities, GCE is characterized on the basis of several defining features: the CVS (lowering and/or retraction of the front lax vowels), /ow/-fronting, /aw/-fronting and Canadian Raising (CR). As Figure 5.7 shows, the CVS extends across most of Canada (even part of the Atlantic provinces) but shows some variation. Using the CVS, we can define an area called “Inland Canada”, whose outer limits extend from Vancouver to Montreal. Within Inland Canada is a smaller region, defined by the more traditional feature of Canadian Raising that includes the area from Alberta to northern Ontario. This characterization provides us with an overall picture of the extent of GCE’s geographical distribu- tion, but the study does not include sufficient number of speakers from each locale within Canada to explore the possibility of regional variation not only between GCE and the other Canadian dialect regions, but also within GCE.
In order to provide a more nuanced analysis of regional variation within Canadian English, a larger study was carried out by Charles Boberg (2008, 2010) through a word list administered to 86 students at McGill University in Montreal who originated from different parts of Canada. The normal- ized means of their vowels, shown in Figure 5.8, reveal the presence of the features characteristic of Canadian English. The CVS can be seen in the lowered and retracted positions of /i/, /e/ and /æ/ relative to the tense vow- els /iy/ and /ey/. Both tense back vowels /uw/ and /ow/ exhibit fronting (shown in relation to their allophones before /l/), and the onset of /aw/ tends to be fronted with respect to the onset of /ay/. Canadian Raising can

92 PHONETICANDPHONOLOGICALVARIATION
 be seen in the higher position of the onsets of /awT/ and /ayT/ (where the T indicates a following voiceless consonant) relative to /aw/ and /ay/.
The vowel means presented in Figure 5.8 represent the combined mea- surements for all 86 informants, regardless of the region of Canada they come from. Table 5.4 displays the vowel measurements that were found to have a

 statistically significant effect for region, summarized graphically in Table 5.5. Note that these regional differences confirm some of the generalizations about larger regions within Canadian English made in the preceding section. The CVS is not significantly different according to region, suggesting that this feature occurs across the entire country. Fronting of /u/ is marginally nonsignificant, which indicates that there may be some slight regional effects. NLE shows itself to be distinct from other regions in its lack of participation in Canadian Raising (indicated by a high F1 value for /awT/, which signals a much lower vowel) and /uw/- and /ow/-fronting (indicated by lower F2 values for /uw/). ME patterns with GCE in participating in Canadian Raising, but it patterns with NLE in not retracting /a/ before /r/. QE does not partici- pate in any of the other phonetic process in other regions. While all varieties of GCE feature Canadian Raising (at least, raising of /aw/ rather than /ay/), Tables 5.4 and 5.5 also reveal some subtle differences between regions. The English spoke in BC and Ontario both feature /u/-fronting, which does not occur in the Prairies. However, the Prairies and BC pattern together against Ontario with respect to raising of /æ/ before velar consonants and the (lack of) fronting of raised /awT/.

 SUMMARY
This chapter considered the sound system of Canadian English, in terms of its phonological systems and their phonetic realizations. Canadian English is dis- tinguished from other varieties of English on the basis of its vowel phonemes, which results from various mergers and shifts. Its main features are the low- back vowel merger, Canadian Raising and the Canadian Vowel shift. Regionally, Canadian English can be divided into several dialect areas: General Canadian English, Quebec English, Maritime English and Newfoundland English. Pho- netic analysis reveals subtle distinctions between and even within these regions.

Canadian English (1967)1
Walter S. Avis
Language in Canada, as in most countries, is taken for granted. Unfortunately, however, a great deal of nonsense is taken for granted by many Canadians. Some people, especially recent arrivals from the United Kingdom, refuse to accept the fact that the English spoken in Canada has any claim to recognition. Others, who themselves speak Canadian English, are satisfied with the view that British English is the only acceptable standard To these people the argument that educated Canadians set their own standard of speech is either treasonable or ridiculous.
One Canadian I know had his eyes opened in a rather curious way. While shopping in a large Chicago department store, he asked where he might find chesterfields. Following directions to the letter, he was somewhat dismayed when he ended up at the cigar counter. He soon made other discoveries as well. Blinds were "shades" to his American neighbors; taps were "faucets," braces "suspenders," and serviettes "napkins."
Before long his American friends were pointing out differences between his speech and theirs. He said been to rhyme with "bean," whereas for them it rhymed with "bin"; and he said shone to rhyme with "gone," whereas for them it rhymed with "bone." In fact, their Canadian friend had quite a few curious ways of saying things: ration rhymed with "fashion" rather than with "nation"; lever with "beaver" rather than "sever"; z with "bed" rather than "bee." Moreover, he said certain vowels in a peculiar way, for lout seemed to have a different vowel sound from loud, and rice a different vowel from rise.
The Englishman is also quick to observe that Canadians talk differently from himself. For example, he doesn’t say dance, half, clerk, tomato, garage, or war as Canadians do; and he always distinguishes cot from caught, a distinction that few Canadians make. He also finds that many of the words he used in England are not understood by people in Canada. Suppose he gets into a conversation about cars. Says he, "I think a car should have a roomy boot." No headway will be made till somebody rescues him by explaining that in Canada the boot is called a "trunk." Before the session is finished, he will probably learn that a bonnet is called a "hood" and the hood of a coupé is "the top of a convertible."

Similarly, he must substitute muffler for silencer, windshield for windscreen, truck for lorry, and gas for petrol.
The examples I have mentioned suggest, quite correctly that Canadian English, while different from both British and American English, is in large measure a blend of both varieties; and to this blend must be added many features which are typically Canadian. The explanation for this mixed character lies primarily in the settlement history of the country, for both Britain and the United States have exerted continuous influence on Canada during the past two hundred years.
As the several areas of Canada were opened to settlement, before, during and after the Revolutionary War in the 1770’s, Americans were prominent among the settlers in many, if not in most, communities. American influence has been great ever since: Canadians often learn from American textbooks, read American novels and periodicals, listen to American radio programs, and watch American T.V. and movies. Moreover, Canadians in large numbers are constantly moving back and forth across the border, as emigrants, as tourists, as students (especially on athletic scholarships), and as bargain hunters. Finally, Canada shares with the United States a large vocabulary denoting all manner of things indigenous to North America. One need only leaf through the full or concise Dictionary of Canadianisms or the Dictionary of Americanisms to appreciate this fact.
On the other hand, Britain has also made an enormous contribution to the settlement of English-speaking Canada. For more than a century and a half, Britishers in an almost continuous stream and speaking various dialects have immigrated to Canada. In most communities, especially those along the Canadian-American border (where most of Canada's population is still concentrated), these newcomers came into contact with already established Canadians; and, as might be expected, their children adopted the speech habits of the communities they moved into. Only in certain settlement areas where relatively homogeneous Old-Country groups established themselves did markedly British dialectal features survive through several generations. Such communities may be found in Newfoundland, the Ottawa Valley, the Red River Settlement in Manitoba, and on Vancouver Island. For the most part, however, the children of British immigrants, like those whose parents come from other European countries, adopt the kind of English spoken in Canada. Yet in the very process of being absorbed, linguistically speaking, they have made contributions to every department of the language.
That part of Canadian English which is neither British nor American is best illustrated by the vocabulary, for there are hundreds of words which are native to Canada or which have meanings peculiar to Canada. As might be expected, many of these refer to topographical features, plants, trees, fish, animals, and birds; and many others to social, economic, and political institutions and activities. Few of these words, which may be called Canadianisms, find their way into British or American dictionaries, a fact which
Canadian English (1967), Walter Avis

should occasion no surprise, for British and American dictionaries are based on British and American usage, being primarily intended for Britons and Americans, not for Canadians.
Prominent among Canadianisms are proper nouns, including names of regions: Barren Grounds [the northern tundra], French Shore [the Newfoundland shoreline where the French retained the right to fish after 1783], Lakehead [the “top” of the Great Lakes watershed around Thunder Bay]; names given to the natives of certain regions: Bluenoses [Nova Scotians], Herringchokers [Maritimers, especially New Brunswickers]; names associated with political parties: New Democratic Party, Union Nationale. In addition, there are a host of terms identified with places or persons: Digby chicken [smoked herring], McIntosh apple, Quebec heater [a tall cylindrical wood stove], Winnipeg couch [a pull-out couch/bed].
Languages other than English have contributed many Canadianisms to the lexicon: (from Canadian French) brulé [burnt-out area], fameuse [a type of apple], lacrosse, Métis, portage; (from Amerindian) babiche [rawhide string], kokanee [a type of salmon], pemmican, shaganappi [rawhide string; hasty, inferior]; (from Eskimo) komatik [dog sled], kuletuk [woman’s parka], ooloo [woman’s semicircular knife], oomiak [woman’s skin-covered rowboat]. Sometimes the origin of such loanwords is obscured in the process of adoption; thus carry-all, mush, Siwash, snye, and shanty derive from Canadian French cariole [horse-drawn sleigh], marche [go], sauvage [savage], chenail [channel], and chantier [logger’s camp].
Other Canadianisms are more or less limited to certain regions - to Newfoundland: jinker [jinx], nunny bag [packsack], tickle [strait], tilt [lean-to]; to the Maritimes: aboideau [marsh dyke with sluice-gate], gaspereau [a small fish], longliner [a fishing boat]; to Ontario: concession roads [roads transecting a township, generally at 1.25 mile intervals], dew-worm [earth worm], fire-reels [a fire truck]; to the Prairie Provinces: bluff [clump of trees], grid roads [rural road, 2 miles apart north-south and 1 mile east-west], local improvement district [a sparsely populated rural municipality governed by the province]; to British Columbia: rancherie [the settlement within an Aboriginal reserve], skookum [big, strong], steelhead [a trout]; to the Northland: bush pilot, cat-swing [a tractor-pulled train of sleds], cheechako [Johnny-come-lately].
Hundreds of Canadian words fall into the category of animal and plant names: caribou, fool hen, inconnu [a northern fish], kinnikinnick [a smoking mixture], malemute, oolichan [a smelt], saskatoon [a berry], sockeye, whisky-jack or Canada jay. Many more fall into the class of topographical terms: butte [rhymes with newt, an isolated hill], coulee [gulch], dalles [rhymes with gals, river rapids between high rock walls], sault [pronounced and spelled informally Soo, waterfalls]. Yet another extensive class includes hundreds of terms of historical significance: Family Compact, Klondiker, North canoe, Red River cart,
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader

wintering partner [fur company representative and shareholder living year round at the trading post], York boat.
For many terms there are special Canadian significations: Confederation, Grit, height of land [watershed], reeve, riding [electoral district, only in Canada], warden. From the sports field come a number of contributions, especially from hockey and a game we used to call rugby, a term now almost displaced by the American term football: boarding, blueline, convert, cushion [natural ice rink], flying wing [Cdn. Football, an extra roving defensive player], puck, rouge [Cdn. Football, a one-point play], snap. And in the same area there are a number of slang terms that merit mention: chippy [pugnacious hockey player], homebrew [an athlete born in Canada], import, rink rat.
In pronunciation, as in vocabulary, Canadians are neither American nor British, though they have much in common with both. Although most Canadians pronounce docile and textile to rhyme with mile, as the British do, it is probable that most pronounce fertile and missile to rhyme with hurtle and missal, as the Americans do. And no doubt Canadians pronounce some words in a way that is typically Canadian. Most of us, for example, would describe the color of a soldier's uniform as khaki, pronounced (kärkē).2 Yet no non- Canadian dictionary recognizes this Canadianism. Americans say (kakē), while the British say (käkē). In Canada, many people put flowers in a vase, pronounced (vāz); Americans use a (vās) and the British a (väz). To be sure, a number of Canadians say something like (väz), especially if the vase is Ming.
If we take imported dictionaries as our authority, such pronunciations as (kärkē) and (vāz) are unacceptable. But surely the proper test of correctness for Canadians should be the usage of educated natives of Canada. Here are some other example of pronunciations widely heard among educated Canadians; few of them are recorded in our imported dictionaries: absolve (ab zolv), arctic (är tik), armada (är mad ə), chassis (chas ē), culinary (kul ə ner ē), evil (ē vəl), finale (fə nal ē), fungi (fung gī), jackal (jak əl), longitude (long gə tüd), official (ō fish əl), opinion (ō pin yən), placate (plak āt), plenary (plen ə rē) prestige (pres tēj’), resources (ri zôr səz), senile (sen īl), species (spē sēz), Trafalgar (trə fol gər).
Of course, not everyone uses all of these forms; yet all are used regularly by educated Canadians in large numbers. Who can deny that (ri zôr səz) and (spē sēz) are more often heard at all levels of Canadian society than (ri sôrs əz) and (spē shēz), the pronunciations indicated in nearly all available dictionaries? Surely, when the evidence of
2 Avis indicates pronunciations with the scheme from Gage dictionaries: ä as in ah; a as in at; ā as in aid; e as in let; ē as in eat; i as in bit; ī as in high; o as in odd; ô as in order; u as in cup; ü as in ooze; g as in go; j as in jam; ng as in long; ch as in child; sh as in she.

usage justifies it, forms such as these should be entered as variants in any dictionary intended to reflect Canadian speech.
Another of the functions of a dictionary is to record the spellings used by the educated people of the community. In spelling, as in vocabulary and pronunciation, Canadian usage is influenced by the practice of both the Americans and the British. In areas where American and British practices differ, Canadian usage is far from uniform. Until recent years, British forms have predominated in most instances, for example, axe, catalogue, centre, colour, cheque, mediaeval, plough, skilful, and woollen (and words of similar pattern), in spite of the obvious practical advantages of the American forms: ax, catalog, center, check, color, medieval, plow, skillful, and woolen. In some cases, however, American spellings have asserted themselves to the virtual exclusion of the corresponding British forms, as in connection, curb, jail, net, recognize, tire, and wagon for connexion, kerb, gaol, nett, recognise, tyre, and waggon.
In recent years there have been indications that American spellings are becoming more commonly used in Canada. Many have, for example, been adopted by Canadian newspapers, especially those in the larger centres, and by magazine and book publishers. Young people seem to use such spellings as color, center, defense, medieval, program, skillful, and traveler much more frequently than was formerly the case, the implication being that at least some American forms are accepted as proper in many Canadian schools. The fact is that usage is very much divided, varying from province to province and often from person to person. For the most part, however, Canadians respond to these variants with equal ease. Under such circumstances, a Canadian dictionary should include both forms, for here, as elsewhere, the lexicographer's obligation is to record usage, not to legislate it.
It has been argued in these pages that there is such a thing as a distinctive variety of Canadian English; yet it should be observed that this distinctive variety is referred to as "Canadian English" and not as "the Canadian language." The fact is that Canadians share one language with Britons, Americans, Australians, and a host of other people, both inside the Commonwealth and beyond it. To claim that there is a Canadian language, or, as many Americans do, an American language, is to distort the meaning of the word language for nationalistic purposes. On the other hand, it is a form of blindness to insist, as many do, that "English is English" and that only fools "dignify the slang and dialect" of Canada by giving it serious attention.

Ethnic patterns in the phonetics of Montreal English1
Charles Boberg
McGill University, Montreal, Canada
Most North American cities no longer display strong ethnic di¡erentiation of speech within the European-origin population. This is not true in the English- speaking community of Montreal, Canada, where English is a minority language. Di¡erences in the phonetic realization of vowels by Montrealers of Irish, Italian, and Jewish ethnic origin are investigated by means of acoustic analysis. A statistical analysis of ethnic di¡erences in formant frequencies shows that ethnicity has a signi¢cant e¡ect on several variables, particularly the phonetic position of /u:/ and /ou/ and the allophonic conditioning of /×/ and /au/ before nasal consonants. The unusual tenacity of ethnophonetic variation in Montreal English is explained in light of the minority status of English, and the social and residential segregation of ethnic groups in distinct neighborhoods, which limits their exposure to speakers of Standard Canadian English who might otherwise serve as models for assimilation.
KEYWORDS: Canadian English, Montreal English, ethnolects, Eng- lish vowels, acoustic analysis, speech communities
1. INTRODUCTION
Even a casual observer with an untrained ear will notice di¡erences in the Eng- lish spoken by various groups of people in Montreal, Canada’s second-largest city. English-speaking Montrealers themselves are aware of these di¡erences. Some people aspirate their ¢nal consonants; others do not. Some people pronounce the <g> of words like hanger and wrong; others do not. Some people frequently substitute a stop, [d], for the voiced interdental fricative of words like the, that, or those; others never do.Vowel sounds are also variable: the vowels /ai/, /au/, /ou/, and /u:/ have quite di¡erent articulations depending on who is producing them. Some people have a fronted and raised pronunciation of /×/ and /au/ before nasal consonants; others do not. The di¡erences even extend beyond phonetics and phonology to vocabulary and syntax. Some people close the lights, clean the snow, and pass the vacuum; others turn o¡ the lights, clear or shovel the snow, and do the vacuuming. Some people use the past tense in constructions like this is the ¢rst time I’ve seen that, or I’ve been living there for

three years already; others use the present tense, as in this is the ¢rst time I see that, or I’m living there three years already.
As in all cities, some of this variation is socially based: age, sex, and socio- economic class have an important part to play in determining the patterns. In Montreal, however, much of it is based on ethnic rather than social categories: Montrealers of British, Italian, and Jewish ancestry, among other groups, exhibit distinct varieties of English. The linguistic assimilation of non-British immigrant groups has been a key part of the evolution of urban speech commu- nities in most of North America, often leading to the development of distinct ethnic varieties, or ethnolects, as a transitional stage between the non-native English of immigrants and full integration into the English-speaking commu- nity. Unlike the second-language English of the original immigrants, these ethnolects are native varieties of English. They are spoken by the immigrants’ North American-born children and grandchildren, who have been exposed to English from an early age, even if they ¢rst learned an immigrant language at home. Yet ethnolects often preserve unique features that distinguish them from the speech of the wider community, some of which can clearly be traced to the non-native varieties that preceded them.
While in some communities unique ethnic features are short-lived, suc- cumbing quickly to assimilation within a single generation, elsewhere they are perpetuated by ethnic isolation that arises from residential, social, educa- tional, and occupational patterns. In Montreal, it will be argued, these factors have been particularly strong, and have been reinforced by the unique local status of English as a minority language, which has isolated speakers of ethnic varieties from a native model to which they might otherwise have assimilated more rapidly. Examining the unusual ethnolectal diversity produced by these circumstances enriches our understanding of the social and linguistic structure and development of language in urban centers, and of the e¡ects of language contact and bilingualism on English. To this end, this paper analyzes several ethnolinguistic variables in Montreal English, focusing on phonetic variation in the articulation of vowels,2 and examines the historical and demo- graphic factors that have contributed to this variation.
1.1 Ethnicity and sociolinguistics
The role of ethnic identity in determining linguistic behavior has been a cen- tral concern of sociolinguistics since its beginning, along with the role of lin- guistic behavior in the construction of ethnic identity. The work of Wolfram (1969) and Labov (1972a), among others, on African American English was fundamental to the development of sociolinguistic methods and principles. As a result, ethnicity has come to be accepted together with age, sex, and social class as one of the primary factors conditioning linguistic variation in a speech community. Unlike these other factors, ethnicity has also been found to divide a political or regional community into two or more speech communities, each

with a structurally distinct grammar. This is frequently the case in the United States, where the African American, European American, and Latino commu- nities in most cities exhibit distinctive linguistic patterns.We might call such patterns racial rather than ethnic, if it did not risk implying some sort of genetic link between grammar and the color of one’s skin. Nevertheless, this is a level of ‘ethnicity’ that involves clearly visible physical characteristics, as well as long-standing socio-cultural di¡erences, among groups who have come to the United States from di¡erent continents and under very di¡erent circumstances. Given the prominent role of racial identity in culture and social organization and the continued social and residential segregation of these groups from one another throughout the twentieth century, it is hardly sur- prising that they should distinguish themselves linguistically.
North American sociolinguistics has paid less attention to ethnolinguistic variation on a smaller scale, within racial groups. The obvious reason for this is that such variation, where it exists, is generally more subtle than variation among racial groups, and therefore less susceptible to observation. Indeed, in many communities, it has virtually disappeared. This is largely true of the African and European American communities, which have been the primary focus of sociolinguistic research to date. Their long histories in the United States have in most cases blurred the ethnolinguistic di¡erences that once existed among Africans or Europeans from di¡erent linguistic backgrounds, though recent immigration has created new variability in some places. It is less true of more recently arrived groups of Asian Americans and Latinos, many of whom continue to live in communities where intra-racial ethnic pat- terns are at least partly intact.
Nevertheless, in most North American cities, linguistic variation within racial groups is primarily social rather than ethnic. Speech patterns are deter- mined by age, sex, and social class, rather than by where one’s ancestors came from. In the European North American community, residential and social segregation of ethnic groups has become rare and intermarriage increasingly common, even among people of di¡erent religious heritage, let alone ethnic identity. Old ethnic ghettos in many cities have given way to new immigrant groups or to gentri¢cation, like the Italian American ‘urban village’ described by Gans in Boston’s West End, which was razed to make way for urban renewal and luxury apartments (Gans 1962: ix). New suburbs are often peopled by ethnically blended families whose primary cultural identi¢cation is with the United States or Canada, rather than with their ancestral groups. Weinfeld shows that, on every measure ranging from residential segregation to lan- guage use to community involvement to homogeneity of friendship networks, native-born Canadian ethnic group members display less ethnic identi¢cation than do immigrants (1985: 71^77). This process of gradual assimilation has included the erosion of previously distinct ethnolinguistic patterns, so that most European North Americans can no longer identify each other’s ethnic origins on the basis of speech. The third- or fourth-generation descendants of

Germans in Cincinnati, Poles in Detroit, Czechs in Cedar Rapids, Swedes in Minneapolis, and Ukrainians in Edmonton are now, for the most part, linguis- tically indistinguishable from fellow citizens of other European ancestries.
The exceptions to this homogeneity have generally been observed in large cities in the north-eastern United States, where the sheer size of some immig- rant groups has provided opportunities for self-segregation beyond the initial generation of immigrants.3 This in turn has preserved ethnically marked patterns of speech. In Labov’s study of NewYork City, while ethnicity was not a primary focus, for two of the most characteristic variables of New York City English it was found to be a more important predictor of behavior than social class. Participants of Italian ancestry were observed to be furthest ahead in the raising of tensed /×/, while those of Jewish ancestry were most advanced in the raising of /c° :/ (Labov 1972b: 172^174, 177, 297^298). Another study of NewYork City English found that Jews were more likely than non-Jews to topic- alize inde¢nite objects by putting them before the subject (Feinstein1980).
In Boston, Laferrie' re (1979) found that Irish, Italian, and Jewish Bostonians were sharply di¡erentiated in the degree to which they maintained a phonemic opposition between two back vowels before /r/ (for versus four, or horse versus hoarse). The maintenance of the opposition is supported in traditional Boston speech by a phonetic realization of one of the classes that has become stigma- tized (pronouncing short, for example, to rhyme with shot). Laferrie' re reported that Jewish participants were the ¢rst to reject the stigmatized pronunciation, thereby eliminating the phonemic opposition, while Irish and Italian partici- pants retained it to a greater degree, indicative of their closer identi¢cation with local vernacular norms. These di¡erences appeared to be associated with the di¡erent rates at which each group had gained access to higher education and come under the homogenizing in£uence of a middle-class social orienta- tion.
In Bu¡alo, Carlock and Wo« lck (1981) found that the descendents of German, Polish, and Italian immigrants could still be identi¢ed and could identify each other on the basis of speech patterns at several levels of grammar, most notably prosody, though these features were declining in salience and diagnostic value as the ethnic groups became less residentially segregated (Wo« lck 2002: 159). For instance, in the raising of tensed /×/, a part of the Northern Cities Shift identi¢ed by Labov, Yaeger, and Steiner (1972: 75), Italian Americans were found to be most advanced (an interesting parallel to Labov’s observation in New York City), followed by participants of Polish heritage, then those of German heritage; ‘Anglo’ or British-ancestry participants were the most conservative, or resistant to this change.
The patterns observed in Boston, New York City, and Bu¡alo date from the 1970s and may have been subject to erosion since those studies were carried out. Without more recent data, we cannot say whether, a generation later, ethnolinguistic variation in those cities remains as strong as it once was. In this paper, it will be shown that ethnolectal diversity in the English-speaking

community of Montreal remains vital. The following sections present the method and results of an exploratory pilot study designed to identify the main parametersofethnicvariationinthevowelsofMontrealEnglish.The¢nalsection examines the historical and demographic factors that support this variation.
2. THE ETHNIC STRUCTURE OF THE MONTREAL ENGLISH-SPEAKING COMMUNITY
The ¢rst task of the pilot study was to develop a hypothetical model of the eth- nic structure of the Montreal English-speaking community, and to design a sample of participants corresponding to this model that would furnish enough data to test some hypotheses about ethnophonetic variation. A statistical pro¢le of the community was developed by consulting national census data on language and ethnicity (Statistics Canada 2001a, b). The relevant data are reproduced in Tables 1 (data on language) and 2 (data on ethnicity).
The ¢rst observation to make about the data in Table 1a is that, with the exception of small groups of English speakers elsewhere in the province of Quebec, Montreal is unique in being the only major city in North America (that is, the United States and Canada), in which English is a minority language on a community-wide basis. In terms of population by mother tongue, two- thirds of people in Greater Montreal speak French, twelve percent speak English, and 19 percent speak a language other than French or English. In language-conscious Montreal, these groups are referred to respectively as

 Francophones, Anglophones, and Allophones.4 The explanatory potential of the minority status of English will be discussed further on; for now, we will focus on the size and ethnic composition of the English-speaking minority.
The size of the English-speaking minority in Montreal can be measured in several ways; this paper will rely on two. First is the number of people who claim English as their mother tongue, or ¢rst language learned and still spoken. This was cited above as twelve percent, or just over 400,000. In a linguis- tically complex community like Montreal, however, mother tongue is not necessarily the most e¡ective criterion for identifying a speaker’s linguistic status or community membership. Many Allophones in fact now use English at work, in school, and even at home, in addition to or instead of their ancestral language. Home languages are shown in Table 1b. If we add up all the cat- egories of people whose repertoire of home languages includes English, we get a total of 886,000, or 26 percent of the metropolitan population. Of course, not all of these people speak native or even near-native English, but the number of people who do is undoubtedly larger than the 400,000 who claim English as their mother tongue. Much of the discrepancy is accounted for by one of the groups that are the subject of this paper: Allophones who ¢rst acquired an immigrant language at home, but were then exposed to English early enough to acquire it as a second native language. In addition, this paper deals with people whose only native language is English, but who are members of ethnic groups that perpetuate distinctive linguistic identities within the Anglophone community.
The size of ethnic groups in Montreal is harder to measure than that of lan- guage groups because of the way Statistics Canada collects data on ethnicity. Rather than asking people to choose from a list of well-understood ethnic descriptors, respondents are invited to provide their own descriptors. As a result, over half of respondents to the 2001 Census identi¢ed themselves as ‘Canadian’, confusing nationality with ethnicity. It is not known how many people in each ethnic group chose this label, though it seems a more likely

choice for long-standing Canadians of British and French ancestry than for those whose families arrived more recently from other lands. The main e¡ect of this ‘Canadian’category, then, is probably to under-represent the proportion of British- and French-origin people in Canada. It certainly means that Statis- tics Canada’s data on the absolute and relative sizes of ethnic groups are lamentably unreliable. Nevertheless, by examining the statistics on ethnic group membership presented in Table 2, we can get a very rough idea of the relative sizes of Montreal’s various ethnic groups. Beyond the 1.9 million ‘Canadians’, 900,000 French, and 400,000 British and Irish, the largest self- described ethnic groups in Montreal are Italians (224,460) and Jews (80,390).
Estimating how many members of these and other ethnic groups have now joined the English-speaking community, or how many of Montreal’s Anglo- phones are of non-British/Irish ethnic origin, is also di⁄cult. It is well known that many Italians and most Jews have now joined the Anglophone community (Jedwab 1996: 63^84). A comparison of linguistic and ethnic groups sheds some light on this process of assimilation. Table 1a shows that only 121,370 people still claim Italian as their mother tongue, about half of the Italian- origin population indicated by Table 2. Linguistic assimilation among Jews, who as a group have been in Montreal longer than Italians, is much higher: fewer than 10,000 people in Montreal still claim Yiddish as their mother ton- gue, a small fraction of the Jewish-origin population.5 Lieberson con¢rms this di¡erence, reporting that, in Greater Montreal in 1961, only 15.6 percent of Canadian-born Italians claimed English as their mother tongue, against 78.7 percent of Canadian-born Jews (1970: 39). The proportion of Italians with mother-tongue English has undoubtedly risen since the early 1960s, when the bulk of the Italian immigrant community was still arriving (or had just arrived) in Canada, but the basic di¡erence between Jews, who for the most part

have been closely integrated into the Anglophone community, and Italians, who occupy a middle ground between the Anglophone and Francophone commu- nities,remainsinforcetoday.
Given the numerical preponderance of people of Irish, Italian, and Jewish ori- gin, these groups were chosen as the basis of the ethnic sample for this study, parallel to that of Laferrie' re (1979) in Boston. Since the pilot study, the Irish group has been expanded to include people of either Irish or British origin, re£ecting the lack of a clear separation between these groups in contemporary Montreal society and a desire to include a wider sample of the traditional Anglo- phone community. The Irish data reported here, however, represent participants of pure Irish extraction. In order to isolate the e¡ects of particular ethnic back- grounds, participation in all three groups was limited to people whose parents shared the same ethnic heritage; people of mixed heritage were not included.
Additional factors considered in sample design were age, sex, and education. Age was divided into three historically relevant generational groups: people born during or before the Second World War; the generation born after the War, between 1946 and 1965 (the ‘baby boomers’); and the generation born after 1965.6 Two education groups were established: those with no post-secondary education beyond one or two years of junior college (most of whom had no more than high school education); and those with one university degree but not more. People with two or more degrees were not included in the sample.
The original design of the pilot study provided for two participants in each cell created by the cross-tabulation of all of these factors, a total of 36 partici- pants, with twelve in each ethnic group. This design was only partially ful¢lled, but the number of participants recruited from each ethnic group was su⁄cient to support a multivariate analysis of the e¡ect of ethnicity on vowel production. The data presented here are based on 35 participants, distributed demographic- ally as shown in Table 3. The demographic characteristics of individual parti- cipants, including their occupations, are shown in Table 4.
A crucial criterion for the inclusion of all participants was that they be native or native-like speakers of English. This presented no problems in the Irish

In order to ensure this, only people who had spent virtually all of their lives, and certainly their entire childhood, in Montreal were included.

in Montreal come from families that have been established in the area for three generations or more; indeed, many arrived during the nineteenth century. With the other ethnic groups, it was not possible to be quite so selective.
Montreal’s Jewish community is composed of three distinct groups: central and eastern European Ashkenazim, most of whose families arrived in Montreal in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and originally spoke Yiddish and/or other central or eastern European languages; Sephardim, whose families came more recently from a wider range of homelands and generally did not speak Yiddish; and Hasidim and other ultra-orthodox Jews who live in small, isolated communities in a very restricted part of the city and distinguish themselves by traditional dress. Participants for this study were drawn from the ¢rst group, the Ashkenazim, who are the predominant group in the English- speaking community; all subsequent discussion of Jewish participants refers exclusively to this group.
It was not possible to insist that the parents of Jewish participants also be fromMontreal.Manyofthemwereborninthecity,especiallythoseofyounger participants, but some were immigrants from Europe. Given that the peak of Ashkenazi Jewish immigration to Quebec occurred before the Second World War, during the 1920s and 30s7, many Jewish Montrealers born after the War, in the intermediate ‘baby boomer’ age group, have immigrant parents. By contrast, the baby boom generation’s children, born after 1965, mostly have Canadian-born parents. As long as their parents had not grown up in some other English-speaking area, and as long as they had themselves grown up in Montreal, Jewish participants with non-local parents were included in the sample.
The criteria for the inclusion of Italian participants had to be further relaxed, since the peak of Italian immigration to Quebec came a generation later than that of Jewish immigration. Most Italians came in the post-war period, during the 1950s and 60s,8 so that participants with local parents were much harder to ¢nd. Most had immigrant parents, and a few had even immigrated them- selves as pre-school-aged children. The vast majority of Italian Montrealers born before 1946 are immigrants who acquired English as a second language intheirlateteensorasadults,andcouldthereforenotbeincludedinthestudy. As with the Jews, it was necessary to accept Italian participants with non- local parents, as long as they had grown up in Italy, rather than in some other English-speakingcommunity.
These immigration patterns motivate a hypothesis about the linguistic status of each group. It should be expected that the Irish group will speak the least marked variety of English in Canadian terms; they will be the local, Mon- treal representative of ‘standard’ Canadian English. This historically Anglo- phone‘control group’can be distinguished from the two historicallyAllophone groups, the Jews and Italians. Of these, the Jews, having arrived earlier and being more closely integrated with the Anglophone community, should show the fewest divergences from Irish speech. The Italians, having arrived later and still being to a greater degree an Allophone community with less contact

548 BOBERG
with the Anglophone community, should be more marked and will show the greatest amount of divergence from Irish speech.
3. ELICITATIONANDANALYSISOFDATA
Data on the speech patterns of the three ethnic groups were elicited by means of tape-recorded sociolinguistic interviews conducted by undergraduate linguistics students at McGill University, usually in participants’ homes or workplaces.9 The interviews lasted approximately one hour and had four sections: (1) demographic information; (2) a word list; (3) a series of minimal pairs featuring potential phonemic contrasts in identical phonetic environ- ments; and (4) conversation about the participant’s opinions and experiences of life in Montreal, with topics ranging from neighborhoods to childhood mem- ories, politics, and emotionally-charged events.
Data for this paper were taken exclusively from the word list, which provides an identical set of data for each participant. This eliminated the possibility that the data from any participant might be in£uenced by the phonetic charac- ter of the particular words that he or she happened to say. It also provided a very severe test of ethno-phonetic di¡erences, since sociolinguistic research has shown that formal conditions of elicitation like word lists tend to cause some degree of convergence toward standard norms of pronunciation. If ethnic di¡erences were found in the pronunciation of word list items, it could be assumed that they would also be present in natural speech, whereas the con- verse could not be assumed.
In addition to investigating several variables of phonemic incidence, the word list was designed to provide data on the vowel phonemes of English in six allopho- nic environments: word-¢nal (where possible); before a voiced obstruent; before a voiceless obstruent; and before /n/, /l/, and /r/. Each vowel was represented by at least one word featuring each of these environments, thereby giving an indi- cation of its allophonic range. For example, the vowel /ou/ was represented by the words toe, coat, code, stone, stole, and sore. Beyond the basic set of words for each vowel, environments known to condition major allophonic di¡erences in particular vowels were represented by several tokens. These included /×/ before nasals and /g/, /au/ and /ai/ in ‘Canadian Raising’ environments before voiceless consonants (Joos 1942; Chambers 1973), and /u:/ and /ou/ in ¢nal and pre-coronal position and before /l/ (the most and least advanced environ- ments, respectively, for the fronting of long back vowels). In the case of /ou/, the additional words were go, boat, bold, and cold. In total, 115 words were analyzed for each participant, or just over 4,000 vowels for the entire sample.
The word list items were digitized and subjected to spectrographic and linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis using the CSL 4400 digitization hardware and acoustic analysis software developed by Kay Elemetrics. The ¢rst and sec- ond formants (F1 and F2) of each word were measured at a single point in the
# Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004

MONTREAL ETHNOLECTS 549
vocalic nucleus using the pair of LPC points that best represented the central tendency of the formant trajectories, or the closest approximation to the articulatory target for the vowel in question. This point was usually the max- imal value for F1, but sometimes a point of in£ection in F2, depending on the articulatory characteristics of the vowel.10 In order to make the formant values of each participant directly comparable with those of other participants, inter- speaker di¡erences due to vocal tract size were eliminated by means of normal- ization. The normalization procedure adopted was the Constant Log Interval Hypothesis version of the additive point system of Nearey (1977), involving a single scaling factor for F1 and F2, calculated as the antilog of the di¡erence between the natural logs of the participant and group F1/F2 means.11

points re£ect a division of the vowels into four subsystems using phonological criteria based on the presence (or absence) and quality of post-nuclear seg- ments. The long front-upgliding vowels /i:, ei, ai, Oi/ are indicated with white triangles, the long back-upgliding vowels /au, ou, u:/ with black squares, the short vowels /I, E, ×, L, U/ with white circles, and the long monophthongal vowels /O:/ and pre-rhotic vowels /@r, Ar/ with grey diamonds. Only the nuclei or primary targets of diphthongal vowels are shown; the trajectories of their glides do not concern us here. Allophones known to be markedly di¡erent from the main distribution of a vowel are shown separately. These include certain vowels before /g/, /l/, anterior nasals ([þnas]), and voiceless consonants ([􏰎vce]).
The data in Figure 1 show two general features of Montreal English that align it clearly with other regional varieties of English spoken in Canada. One is the absence of a phonemic distinction between the low-back vowels /Q/ (cot, stock, don) and /O:/ (caught, stalk, dawn), often referred to as the ‘low-back merger’ (Labov1994:316^317).Aone-tailed,paired-samplet-testofthemeanF1andF2 measurements of these vowels for the 35 participants revealed no signi¢cant di¡erence in either height or advancement, indicating that the vowels should be represented as a single phoneme.12 This phoneme is considered to have the sub- systemic properties of the long, monopthongal /O:/ rather than the short /Q/ because unlike short vowels it can appear in primary-stress open syllables (law, saw, straw, etc.). The other typically Canadian feature of the Montreal English vowel system is that /×/ remains a low-front vowel except before nasal conso- nants: there is no general raising of /×/ to mid position as in the Northern Cities dialect of the United States, and no split of /×/ into tense and lax categories as in Mid-Atlantic American dialects (Labov 1991: 12, 30).
There is, however, one feature of the Montreal English vowel system that distinguishes it from other Canadian varieties. This concerns the phonemic distinction between /×/ and /E/ before /r/ (marry and carry versus merry and berry). Most of Canada shows a conditioned merger of /×/ and /E/ in this environment, resulting in a mid-front articulation for both sets of words, also typical of most regions of the United States outside the Atlantic seaboard. InMontreal,bycontrast,thelow-frontpronunciationof/×/before/r/isretained, just as in Standard British English, or in the varieties of American English spoken in coastal cities like New York and Philadelphia. A one-tailed, paired- sample t-test of the mean F1 and F2 measurements of these allophones for the 35 participants revealed signi¢cant di¡erences in both the height and advance- ment dimensions. The data on this contrast are provided in Table 5.

Because all formant measurements have been normalized, and because all of the charts show the same set of vowels and allophones plotted on identical axes, it is possible to make direct visual comparisons of the three systems. Such compari- sons suggest that the largest ethnic di¡erences involve the subsystem of back- upgliding vowels: /u:/ appears to be further back for Italians, while /ou/ appears

to be both lower and further forward for Jews. These di¡erences only apply to the main distributions of these vowels, and not to their allophones before /l/, which are comparatively invariant, remaining near the rear periphery of the vowel space. While the allophones of /au/ before voiceless consonants, before nasals, and in other environments maintain the same orientation with respect to one another for all three ethnic groups, indicating a pan-ethnic system of allophonic conditioning, the whole set of allophones appears to be lower and slightly further backforItalians.Indeed,theItalianvowelspaceasawholeextendsabout100Hz further down than those of the other groups: /ai/, /×/, and /Q-O:/ are also articulated in a lower position. By contrast with the back-upgliding vowels, the front-upgliding vowels show only minor ethnic di¡erences. The only di¡erence beyond the lower Italian articulation of /ai/ just mentioned appears to be that /ei/ is further back (i.e. somewhat centralized) for Jews. The short vowels show a remarkable consistency among the three groups, except, as already mentioned, for the height of the low vowels, /×/ and /Q/, and the allophone of /×/ that occurs before nasals, which appears to be higher and further forward for Irish speakers than for the other groups. The vowels before /r/ also show no major ethnic di¡erences. These visual observations suggest that a more precise analysis of ethnic di¡erences in vowel articulation should examine the following phonetic variables:

In order to test whether ethnicity has a signi¢cant independent e¡ect on these phonetic variables, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was per- formed using the general linear model of SPSS,13 with age, sex, and education held constant as covariates. The result of this test was F (2,32) 1⁄4 2.255, with p < 0.05. This con¢rms the visual evidence that ethnicity has an independent e¡ect on the selected variables, and allows us to proceed with analyses of which variables it a¡ects, and in what ways. In order to test which of the phonetic vari- ablesaresigni¢cantlycorrelatedwithethnicity,aseriesofanalysisofcovariance (ANCOVA) tests was performed. The results are shown in Table 6. In order to do post hoc tests on the nature of the correlations, it was also necessary to perform a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), looking at ethnicity alone as an independent variable, without the other demographic variables as covariates.

 The result of this test was F (2,32) 1⁄4 2.542, with p < 0.005, corroborating the ¢nding of the MANCOVA that ethnicity has a signi¢cant e¡ect. In a parallel fash- ion, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were also performed to see which phonetic variables were being signi¢cantly a¡ected by ethnicity in the statistical model withoutcovariates.TheseresultsarealsoshowninTable6.Theallophonicenvir- onments [þnas] and [􏰎vce] are abbreviated as N and T, respectively.
Table 6 shows that signi¢cant correlations with ethnicity were found for the following ten variables:

The remaining variables ^ the F1 and F2 of /auT/, the F1 of /auN/, the F2 of /ei/, the F1 of /×/, and the F1 of /×N/ ^ were not found to be signi¢cantly correlated with ethnicity, despite the apparent di¡erences noted in the visual inspection of the vowel charts. However, it should be noted that the F2 of /auT/, the F1of /auN/ and the F2 of /ei/ showed probabilities very close to the critical alpha of 0.05, (0.059, 0.073, and 0.084, respectively), suggesting marginal signi¢cance that might appear more robust with a larger sample. Nevertheless, we will set these variables aside for future research and limit our attention from this point forward to the variables that showed correlations with ethnicity at a level below p 1⁄4 0.05.(For a study of the Canadian Raising of /au/ in Montreal English, see Hung,DavisonandChambers1993.)
In order to see which ethnic di¡erences are signi¢cant for each of these vari- ables, post hoc Tukey HSD tests were performed in SPSS. The results are shown in Table 7. They support the hypothesis put forward above, that Italians will be the most marked of the three ethnic groups. The largest number of signi¢cant di¡erences divides the Italian group from the other groups (six signi¢cant di¡er- ences with each group); a comparatively small number of signi¢cant di¡erences (three) divides the Irish and Jewish groups. Nevertheless, both the Italian and Jewish groups can be distinguished phonetically in several ways.
As suggested by the visual comparison of vowel charts, the most distinctive feature of Jewish Montreal English concerns the articulation of /ou/, which is

comparatively centralized and lowered relative to its peripheral position for the other groups. This is in fact the only way in which Jewish speech is distin- guished from both of the other ethnic varieties. The centralization of /ou/ is not normally associated with Canadian speech, except in Newfoundland, where it is also moderate. Rather, it is a typical feature of Midland and South- ern varieties of American English, and of Southern British English, where it is considerably more advanced than among Jewish Montrealers. In Labov’s analysis of common patterns in chain shifting (Labov 1994: 116, 208), the cen- tralization of /ou/ is shown to be frequently associated with a parallel centralization of /u:/, another member of the back-upgliding subsystem of vowels, as in the Southern Shift. The centralization of /u:/ can be observed today in many varieties of English across North America, including most of Canada. In some of these varieties, many allophones of /u:/ have advanced into the front half of the vowel space. The data in Figure 1 show this trend to be underway in Montreal, as well.While this parallel movement of /u:/ may also be the origin of /ou/ centralization in Jewish Montreal English, it is not clear why the parallelism should not also have a¡ected Irish Montreal English, which shows an equally advanced stage of the centralization of /u:/ but no centralization of /ou/.
If Jewish Montrealers are unusually advanced in the centralization of back- upgliding vowels, Italians distinguish themselves by being unusually conser- vative in the same respect. They provide a striking exception to the general North American trend toward a centralized pronunciation of /u:/, having a mean F2 for this vowel that is more than 200 Hz lower than those of the other ethnic groups. This is consistent with popular stereotypes of Italian-American speech, or of ‘Brooklynese’, which is also to some extent stereotypically associated with Italian-Americans.14 Another element of the Italian pattern in the subsystem of back-upgliding vowels can be seen in the articulation of /au/, for which Italians have a lower mean F2 than do Jews. Before nasal con- sonants, the mean Italian F2 of /au/ is signi¢cantly lower than that of both of the other groups. Italians retain a low-central pronunciation in words like down, while the other groups have a comparatively fronted allophone in this environment.
The other distinctive characteristics of Italian speech concern F1, or vowel height, rather than F2, or vowel advancement. The Italian participants have higher mean F1 measurements than Irish participants (and therefore lower or more open articulations) for the low vowels /au/, /ai/, and /Q/. Given the lack of any structural connection among these vowels that might explain their common behavior (all three of them belong to di¡erent subsystems), the only conclusion to be drawn from these data is that Italians generally open their mouths more when they talk. It is perhaps surprising that these di¡erences turned out to be statistically robust, since general articulatory characteristics like di¡erences in articulatory e¡ort are normally thought to apply to individuals rather than to groups of people. Indeed, statements about

the speech of particular groups being lazy, careful, or nasal, etc. are usually the product of popular linguistic stereotypes and prejudice, rather than of scienti¢c observation. Nevertheless, we have no option but to put forward such a charac- terization here: Italians appear to be more vigorous speakers than Irish people. The di¡erences in vowel height between Italians and Jews are not as pro- nounced, being signi¢cant only for /ai/, but they follow the same pattern.
The fact that both Irish and Jewish speakers have a lower F1 of /ai/ than Italians do highlights the fact that the normal Montreal articulation of this vowel is comparatively high and back relative to its pronunciation in other dialects of North American English. This can be seen in Figures 2 and 4, which show a fairly close approximation (100^150 Hz) between the nucleus of /ai/ and the merger of /Q/ and /O:/ in lower-mid back position. One result of this is that Canadian Raising of /ai/ involves fronting rather than raising for many Montrealers: the main di¡erence between the allophones of /ai/ before voiceless obstruents and elsewhere is in the F2 dimension, not in F1. Another result is that the raised and backed articulation of /ai/ is advanced enough to cause words like line and tie to sound fairly close to loin and toy to some non-Montrealers, though there is no confusion of the vowels in Montreal, since the relative distance between /ai/ and /Oi/ is maintained by a correspondingly high articulation of /Oi/ in upper-mid back position. However, the author’s anecdotal observation that raising and backing of /ai/ is particularly associated with Jewish Montreal English was not con¢rmed by this study, since the Jewish and Irish productions of /ai/ did not di¡er signi¢cantly in either the height or advancement dimensions.
While we have so far been treating the Irish group as a control against which the experimental populations of Italians and Jews can be compared, there is one variable that could just as well be seen as distinguishing Irish speech, rather than distinguishing both of the historically Allophone groups. This is the occurrence of fronted allophones of /×/ before nasal consonants. Like most varieties of North American English, including several in other parts of Canada, Irish Montreal English features a fronted allophone of /×/ in this environment, represented here by the words band, ham, stamp, and tan. The pre-nasal allophone is also somewhat higher than non-pre-nasal /×/, but ethnic di¡erences in the height dimension did not attain signi¢cance in the multivariate analyses. While North American dialects di¡er famously in the environments that condition fronted and raised allophones of /×/ (Labov 1991), the four words studied here, being monosyllables closed by nasal consonants, would feature fronted and raised allophones virtually everywhere on the continent. Jewish and Italian Montreal English are highly unusual in being an exception to this pattern. Indeed, one of the most striking features of Montreal English for the outsider is its low-front, sometimes almost low- central articulation of /×/ before nasals.
Taken together, the ethnophonetic di¡erences identi¢ed here cause the varieties of English spoken by Irish, Italian, and Jewish Montrealers to sound

remarkably distinct from one another, particularly when di¡erences in vowel production are combined with other, non-vocalic variables, some of which were mentioned above, in the introduction. The scope of this variation is purely phonetic, in the sense that no di¡erences in phonemic inventory were iden- ti¢ed. At the level of phonemic structure, members of all three of the groups studied here speak a common variety, Montreal English, which itself di¡ers from other regional varieties of Canadian English in only one detail at this level: the phonemic distinction between /×/ and /e/ before /r/. Nevertheless, the ethnic di¡erences reported here involve some of the same variables ^ di¡erent degrees of back vowel centralization and di¡erent allophonic conditioning of /×/ ^ as have been used to establish major dialect divisions in American English. In Montreal, we ¢nd this kind of variation within a single city: Jews exhibit a Midland-like advancement of back upgliding vowels away from the rear periphery of the vowel space, while Italians exhibit a Northern- like conservatism in this respect; Irish Montrealers exhibit clear and regular raising of /×/ before nasal consonants, while both Italian and Jewish speakers exhibit only variable raising, if any at all. Future research may con¢rm that the Midland-like Jewish pattern of non-peripheral nuclei for upgliding vowels also extends to the front vowel /ei/, and that Canadian Raising among Irish speakers produces a more advanced variant of /au/ before voiceless obstruents.
6. DISCUSSION
The preceding section identi¢ed phonetic variation at statistically signi¢cant levels among three ethnic groups in the English-speaking community of Montreal. This section will put forward a socio-historical explanation for this variation, taking account of two factors: the status of English as a minority lan- guage in Montreal; and the residential patterns of the ethnic groups in question.
6.1 English as a minority language
The small proportionate size of Montreal’s English-speaking community, cited above as ranging from 12 to 26 percent of the metropolitan population, is a relatively recent development in the city’s history. While the original European settlement of Montreal was French, beginning in the seventeenth century, the struggle between France and England for control of North America ended with the fall of Quebec in 1759 and the surrender of Montreal to British forces the following year. In 1763, the Treaty of Paris ceded French possessions in Canada to Britain. With the British victory came British administrators and colonists, making Montreal a bilingual city. By the mid-1800s, English speakers had attained majority status15 and dominated industry, commerce, and administration.
The numerical superiority of the English-speaking community was short- lived, however. While Anglophones held on to their dominant position in

Montrealsociety,theFrench-speakingpopulationbegantogrowrapidlyinthe late nineteenth century, as a result of both natural increase and industrializa- tion, which caused thousands of rural Francophones to seek employment in the city. By the early twentieth century, Francophones were solidly re-estab- lished as a majority in Montreal,16 but faced two threats to their cultural survi- val. One was from the continued socio-economic superiority of English, which created an almost diglossic situation in which French was in some respects the ‘low variety’ and English the language of many workplaces and of socio- economic advancement outside the French-Canadian community. The other threat was from continued immigration, but now from southern and eastern Europe rather than from Britain. Many Allophone immigrants chose to send their children to English schools, thus adding substantially to the size and in£uence of the Anglophone community.
In the 1970s, Francophone voters concerned about the continued survival of their language and culture supported the enactment of language planning measures that were intended to prevent the further decline of French by reversing the diglossic situation (Bourhis 2001). French was declared the sole o⁄cial language of Quebec and laws were passed restricting the use of English on public signs, enforcing the use of French as the principal language in large businesses, and compelling new immigrants to send their children to French schools. Many English speakers resented this change of circumstances and left Quebec. Montreal’s Anglophone population fell from a peak of 608,000 in the 1976 census to the 408,000 reported in Table 1, a loss of 200,000 people, or almost a third of the community, in twenty-¢ve years. Those Anglophones who have remained now constitute a minority language community in a very real sense, not merely numerically.
One e¡ect of this minority status has been to limit the degree to which Allo- phone immigrants are exposed to native varieties of Canadian English that might serve as models or targets for linguistic assimilation.17 In most other cities in North America, English is omnipresent; newcomers are surrounded by models of the local variety of English on which to base their own speech. Such models are of course available through the mass media in Montreal, and to some extent in educational and vocational contexts, but the fact that so much daily, ordinary interaction with fellow citizens takes place in French rather than English has an insulating e¡ect, increasing the proportion of second-language to ¢rst-language English that an immigrant or immigrant’s child is exposed to. This makes it less likely that substratum e¡ects from an immigrant language learned and still spoken at home will be eliminated by assimilation to the local native variety of standard English.
6.2 ResidentialconcentrationofethnicgroupsinMontreal
Access to native varieties of Canadian English is further impaired by the resi- dential patterns of Montreal’s ethnic groups, which show a remarkable degree

of concentration in ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods. All immigrants, when they ¢rst arrive in a new country, tend to cluster together in certain neighborhoods in order to enjoy the support and companionship of fellow citi- zens who share the same language, religion, and culture. Immigrants to Mon- treal have been no exception to this pattern.What distinguishes the quality of ethnic life in Montreal is the degree to which self-segregation has persisted beyond the ¢rst generations of immigrants.
The three ethnic groups studied here are heavily concentrated in three widely separated sections of the Montreal metropolitan region.18 Traditionally, the Island of Montreal has been split between English-speaking areas to the west and French-speaking areas to the east, with downtown in the middle. People of British and Irish ancestry still tend to live in the suburbs of the western half of the island, referred to locally as the West Island.19 The communities of Pointe Claire, Beacons¢eld, and Baie d’Urfe¤ , for example, all have English- speaking and British/Irish ethnic majorities. They are part of a trajectory of Anglophone settlement stretching west of the city at a distance of ten to 30 km from the downtown core. Closer to downtown, on the western side of central Montreal, are the major areas of Ashkenazi Jewish settlement, particularly the communities of Co“ te-St-Luc and Hampstead and sections of St-Laurent, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, and western Montreal itself. These Jewish areas are more or less continuous with the British/Irish suburbs further west. The Italian population, by contrast, is centered in several communities of north-east Montreal, particularly St-Michel, Montre¤al-Nord, St-Le¤onard, and Rivie' re-des-Prairies, which are much closer to the majority of the Francophone population in the east end than to Jewish areas in the west end or the Anglophone suburbs of theWest Island.
There are two important aspects to ethnic residential patterns. One is the concentration of people of certain ethnic groups in certain neighborhoods. For example, Jews form a solid majority of the residents of Hampstead and Co“ te- St-Luc, rising to more than 80 percent in one census tract,20 while Italians are the plurality in St-Le¤ onard and Rivie' re-des-Prairies, forming a majority in certain neighborhoods.21 Such concentrations encourage the formation of the strong social network ties that Milroy and Milroy (1978), Milroy (2002), and Milroy and Gordon (2003) have argued are important factors in the mainten- ance of local speech patterns, encouraging resistance to assimilatory pres- sures from outside the community. These strong ties tend to reinforce substrate patterns from immigrant languages, as many Jews and Italians talk and interact mostly with members of their own ethnic groups.
The other important aspect of ethnic residential patterns is the absence in many ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods of substantial numbers of people from other ethnic groups. While a few Italians live in the Anglophone areas of the West Island, virtually no Jews live in the Italian neighborhoods of the east end.22 Most crucially, given their potential role as models for linguistic assimilation, people of British and Irish ethnic origin are fairly scarce in the
# Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004

562 BOBERG
main Jewish neighborhoods and even less numerous in the main Italian com- munities.23 Moreover, there is very little reason for Jews and Italians to visit each other’s neighborhoods, or for either of these groups to venture out to the British/Irish suburbs of the West Island: the only common ground where all three groups regularly interact is in institutional, educational, or occupational settings in central Montreal. This means that the children and grandchildren of Jewish and Italian immigrants grow up in neighborhoods and go to schools where models of standard, native Canadian English are few and far between, at least in the form of speakers with whom they might have the sort of extensive and frequent two-way interactions that are thought by sociolinguists to be the main conduit of interpersonal linguistic in£uence.
Of course, not all Jews and Italians live in neighborhoods where their own ethnic groups are heavily concentrated. Social network theory would predict that Jews and Italians who have less intensive and exclusive contact with mem- bers of their own ethnic groups, and more extensive and frequent contact with native Anglophones, would develop weaker network ties and would therefore be more open to assimilatory in£uence. Conversely, people of British/Irish ethnicity who become deeply involved in a Jewish or Italian social network, perhaps as a result of growing up in a certain neighborhood or going to a certain school, might adopt local speech patterns rather than those of their own ethnic group. The sample of the current study is not large enough to test this hypoth- esis systematically, but anecdotal observations of variation among the subjects in each ethnic group suggest that it would be con¢rmed by systematic examination in the future.While the patterns observed in this paper are clearly ethnic in origin, they may also be in£uenced by social network and by neigh- borhood, or urban geographic space: east end versus west end. Such an in£uence would recall the ¢nding of Milroy’s study of Belfast that ethno- religious speech di¡erences in that city were as much spatial as ethnic. East Belfast speech is associated with Protestants and West Belfast speech with Catholics, but these are not exclusive associations, suggesting that some of the variation observed may be tied to neighborhood in a strictly geographic sense, rather than to social categories (Milroy and Gordon 2003: 114). The extent to which this might apply in the case of Montreal could only be assessed by a larger study in the future, in which ethnicity and neighborhood were both controlled for in the sample design.
The fact that both Italians and Jews tend to be physically isolated from Brit- ish/Irish Anglophones in Montreal does not explain the hypothesis, con¢rmed by the data presented above, that Jewish speech is closer than Italian speech to the local British/Irish standard. A large part of the explanation for this di¡er- ence is in the more recent arrival of the bulk of the Italian population, referred to above: Jews have had, on the whole, one more generation to assimilate lin- guistically. Moreover, this extra time was during a period when the use of Eng- lish was not as restricted in public life as it now is, making potential models of native English more readily available to Jewish children in the 1950s than to

Italian children in the 1980s. Many Italian children still speak or at least hear Italian at home, whereas few Jewish children still hear Yiddish, much less speak it. Substrate patterns from Italian, like the rear-peripheral articulation of back-upgliding vowels and the low-central articulation of /au/, are therefore still present in the English of many young Montreal Italians, even though they have native command of English. Another important di¡erence, however, separates the two groups: levels of education, found by Laferrie' re (1979) to be a crucial factor in linguistic assimilation.
Not only did the Jews generally arrive earlier than the Italians, they also had earlier access to higher education, and therefore exposure to mainstream, middle-class, Canadian English. Citing Statistics Canada data on people over the age of 25 in 1961, Kalbach (1970: 192^193) shows that 22.4 percent of native- born Canadian Jews had a university education, compared to only ¢ve percent of native-born Canadian Italians, and 8.4 percent of native-born Canadians of British ancestry. Canadian Jews constituted, by a wide margin, the best-educated segment of the population. Among pre-war immigrants,7 percent of Jews had a university education, compared to only 1.7 percent of Italians (82.4 percent of whom had only elementary schooling or less). Among post- war immigrants, 15.1 percent of Jews had a university education, compared to 1.3 percent of Italians. Only 10.5 percent of Italians had even a secondary school educations, compared to 42.3 percent of Jews, while 88.2 percent of Italians had elementary schooling or less, compared to only 42.6 percent of Jews. These wide di¡erences in educational levels have greatly diminished since Kalbach’s study, but they do emphasize the di¡erent socio-economic circumstances of the two groups in question. These circumstances, together with di¡erences in average date of arrival, gave Jews a distinct advantage over Italians in terms of exposure to Standard Canadian English, and help to explain the more highly distinctive pattern of Italian speech.
7. CONCLUSION
This paper has shown that the English-speaking community of Montreal is an exception to the general lack of strong linguistic di¡erentiation among European-descended ethnic groups in North American cities. Statistical analysis found signi¢cant di¡erences in the vowel production of participants of Irish, Italian, and Jewish ethnic origin. In particular, Jewish participants were relatively advanced in the centralization of back upgliding vowels, having extended this pattern from /u:/ to /ou/, whereas Italian participants were conservative in the same respect, showing relatively little centralization of /u:/, and none of /ou/. Di¡erences were also found in the articulation of /×/ and /au/ before nasal consonants. The existence of these di¡erences was explained by reference to the minority status of English in Montreal and the residential segregation of ethnic groups in homogeneous neighborhoods.

These factors were said to restrict the access of immigrants and their children to native models of native Canadian English, thereby delaying assimilation to these models and perpetuating ethnolinguistic di¡erentiation longer than it has existed in cities where English is the majority language, and where ethnic groups are less segregated residentially.
The ethnic diversity of Montreal English, like many other forms of social variation within urban speech communities, provides an interesting challenge for dialectology. A natural concern of North American dialectology is the descrip- tion and explanation of the boundaries among various regional varieties. In Canada, for instance, a comparison of the dialects of the country’s two largest cities,Toronto and Montreal, is an appealing project, which has been attempted in the past (Hamilton 1958; Boberg 2004). This project is made much more compli- cated by the ethnophonetic di¡erences reported above. A phonetic comparison of Toronto and Montreal English based on data from British/Irish Montrealers would turn up very few di¡erences. The Canadian Raising, centralization of /u:/, and pre-nasal fronting of /×/ and /au/ shown by this group are all shared with Toronto English. A phonetic comparison that included Jewish and Italian Mon- trealers, on the other hand, would turn up di¡erences that could not be accounted for by a simple regional model. Using data from these groups, it could be argued thatpre-nasalraisingof/×/isavariablethatdistinguishesTorontoandMontreal.
The results of the pilot study presented here suggest a wide range of possibil- ities for future research. Many of these will be addressed by a full-scale research project, based on the pilot study, which is now underway.24 First, the prelimin- ary results call for an examination of the interaction of ethnicity with other social factors in predicting phonetic patterns. For example, many Italian Montrealers exhibit no Canadian Raising at all: the articulation of /au/ is as low and central before voiceless consonants as elsewhere. (Hung, Davison and Chambers (1993: 262) also noted variation in Canadian Raising in Montreal, suggesting that Montrealers ‘‘seem to lack a norm or standard’’ for this variable.) Table 6 shows that the F1 of /au/ before voiceless consonants, which is indeed higher for Italian participants, was signi¢cantly correlated with ethnicity in the ANOVA, but not in the ANCOVA, when other demographic factors were held constant. This suggests an interaction. There is a great deal of variation in the Italian F1 values: the standard deviation (95 Hz) is consider- ably higher than those of the other groups (61 Hz and 55 Hz). Indeed, the data on individual participants show that some Italians raise pre-voiceless /au/ as much as British/Irish participants do, while others show no di¡erence between this and other allophones. The variation can likely be explained at least in part by di¡erential exposure to English versus Italian, but the larger sample of the full project will allow a detailed analysis of the factors that determine the acquisition of this hallmark of Canadian English. Other subjects for future research include the e¡ect of speech style on the vocalic variables studied here, drawing on data from the conversational portions of the interviews, and the extension of the research to consonantal variables and to other ethnic groups and cities.

5. Of course, not all of the people who claim Jewish ethnic identity are of originally Yiddish-speaking, Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry: Yiddish is only one of many languages spoken by Jewish immigrants to Canada. Nevertheless, the small size of the Yiddish-speaking population gives some idea of the linguistic assimilation of the dominant group of Jewish immigrants, who were of Yiddish-speaking, central- and east-European background.
6. These generational groups are derived from the analysis of Howe and Strauss (1993), who argue that they represent signi¢cant shifts in outlook, experience, and popular culture. The ¢rst group’s socialization was dominated by the Depression and the Second World War; the second by the Cold War and the counter-cultural and civil rights movements of the1960s; and the third by the aftermath of the1960s.
7. Kalbach (1970: 133) presents Statistics Canada data showing that Jews made up 11 percent of pre-war immigrants to Quebec, but only 6 percent in the post-war period, when southern Europeans became the dominant immigrant group. Similarly,Weinfeld (1985: 69) reports that, in 1971, three-quarters of Toronto Jews had arrived in Canada before World War II.
8. Kalbach (1970: 133) reports that Southern Europeans comprised only 7 percent of pre-war immigrants but 32 percent after the War. The sudden in£ux of Italians after the War is striking. Only 36,705 Italians came to Canada in the entire period from 1926 to 1950. By contrast, in the ¢ve years from 1951 to 1955, 116,035 Italians arrived, a number that increased in the next two ¢ve-year periods to 137,618 and 152,706, respectively (Kalbach 1970: 42). Similarly, Weinfeld (1985: 69) reports that, in 1971, 86 percent of Toronto Italians had arrived after World War II.

2.5 The world comes to Canada: modern Canadian English as a multi-ethnic language in a multilingual setting
The great immigration boom of the early twentieth century had initiated a diversification of Canada’s ethnic character, introducing the first substan- tial populations of neither Aboriginal nor British or French ancestry (other than small groups of Germans). The proportion of the Canadian popula- tion claiming British ethnic origin declined gradually from 61 percent in 1871 to 57 percent in 1901 to 52 percent in 1931. The French component, while growing rapidly through natural increase, was also declining slowly in proportional terms, from 31 percent in 1871 to 28 percent in 1931. The proportion of other ethnic origins climbed rapidly during this period, from 8 percent in 1871 to 20 percent in 1931: a fifth of Canadians were already excluded by the founding conception of Canada as a Franco-British amal- gam. Following World War II, this traditional conception became even more outdated, as millions of immigrants were added to Canada’s population, first from all over Europe, then increasingly from non-European sources,

especially Asia. Canada would become a multicultural society, and Canadian English a multi-ethnic language.
Late twentieth-century immigration is measured in the millions: about 1.5 million immigrants arrived in Canada in each decade from the end of World War II to the 1970s, an average of 150,000 people per year. About a third of this quantity was lost through emigration, leaving about a million people gained through net migration in each decade. The post-war influx peaked at almost 300,000 in 1957 and at over 200,000 in 1967 and 1974 (McIn- nis 2000b: 583, 595). Since the 1990s, the annual average has grown closer to 200,000 arrivals while the rate of natural increase among the native population has declined, so that the immigrant proportion of the Canadian population has started to rise once again from a low of 15 percent in 1951. In 2001, it stood at 18 percent, or 5.5 million people out of a population of almost 30 million.
During the immediate post-war period through the 1960s, 87 percent of the immigrants continued to come from the traditional sources of the early twentieth century, but immigration from Britain (24 percent) was overwhelmed by that from Europe (56 percent). Northern Europe was the largest single source of immigrants in the first decade after World War II (30 percent), giving way to southern Europe from the mid 1950s through the 1960s (27 percent; McInnis 2000b: 585). By 1971, following the great European influx, Canada had 21.6 million people, of whom only 45 percent were of British and 29 percent of French ethnicity; 23 percent were now of other European origins, including 1.3 million Germans, 731,000 Italians, 581,000 Ukrainians, 426,000 Dutch, 316,000 Poles and 297,000 Jews, the six largest non-Franco-British ethnic groups. The ethnic composition of the Canadian population in 1971 is shown in Figure 2.7.

2.5 Modern Canadian English as a multi-ethnic language 97
After the 1960s, immigration came increasingly from non-traditional sources, particularly Asia, but also the Caribbean, the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere, as indicated by the discussion of non-official lan- guages in Chapter 1. By 2001, there were over 2 million people of pure or partly Asian descent in Canada, almost 8 percent of the population, includ- ing over 700,000 who claimed pure or partly East Indian heritage and over a million who claimed pure or partly Chinese heritage. That said, the analy- sis of ethnicity became considerably more complex by the new millennium. For one thing, intermarriage created increasing numbers of people with more than one ethnicity, so that the statistics are now divided among sin- gle and multiple responses, the total of these being substantially greater than Canada’s population; the number of respondents claiming multiple or blended ethnic identities is now considerably greater than the number claiming a single identity. Intermarriage has nearly obliterated some ethnic groups in Canada, while leaving others almost unaffected. If ethnic purity is measured as the proportion of people reporting a single ethnic affiliation out of the total number of people reporting either single or partial affiliations with that ethnic group, the groups with the highest rates of assimilation are Welsh, Americans, Swedes, Norwegians, Irish, Scots and Danes; those with the lowest rates of assimilation are Chinese, East Indians, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Portuguese, Greeks and Jamaicans. To take the extreme cases, only 8 percent of Canadians reporting Welsh ancestry consider themselves to be purely Welsh, whereas 86 percent of Chinese Canadians claim no other ethnic identification than Chinese. East Indians are 82 percent “pure,” while Swedes are 89 percent mixed. British and Scandinavian Canadians in par- ticular have intermarried freely with one another, thereby creating a large northwest-European ethnic continuum and greatly reducing their ethnic dis- tinctiveness. By contrast, Asians and southern Europeans have tended to hold themselves apart, strongly resisting or being excluded from intermarriage, thereby retaining stronger ethnic identities. This difference may be mostly a matter of time, the more distinct groups having arrived more recently, but undoubtedly also reflects degrees of physical and cultural difference between the groups involved and the majority of the Canadian population. (The failure of some groups to integrate with the larger population is an important facet of the discussion of ethnophonetic differences in Chapter 5, Section 5.3.)
Another complication in the measurement of ethnicity stems from Statis- tics Canada’s introduction of a new category, “Canadian”, which is a sub- jective, cultural category rather than an objective, ethnic category and is difficult to integrate with an ethnic analysis. The “Canadian” responses can be assumed to be mostly from Franco-British Canadians of old stock, rather than from more recently arrived people who still identify with other ethnic groups. Moreover, they may reflect a genuine feeling among some respon- dents that they are now simply Canadian rather than British or French or

98 Canada’s English-speaking population
something else, particularly if their ancestors arrived several generations ago from different places. Nevertheless, promotion of national feeling aside, the new response category has introduced an element of uncertainty in the study of ethnicity in Canada, beyond that necessarily connected with multiple identities.
A comparison of ethnic and language data gives ample evidence of the gradual linguistic assimilation of Canada’s non-Franco-British ethnic groups into the country’s two official-language communities, providing millions of new speakers of Canadian English and, to a lesser degree, French. The rates of assimilation for the various groups closely reflect not only their rel- ative time of arrival but also the differing rates of intermarriage already discussed. All three of these processes are of course tightly linked: the passage of the generations leads to intermarriage, which in turn acceler- ates cultural assimilation and heritage language loss. For example, Canada’s 850,000 native speakers of Chinese represent 91 percent of its population of pure Chinese ethnic origin; very few pure Chinese Canadians have lost their heritage language. By contrast, the large European groups who came in the post-war years have begun to experience considerable heritage lan- guage erosion. Even when people of mixed ethnicity are excluded from the analysis, the proportion of native speakers is now only two-thirds of the pure German and Italian populations. Among those of partly German or Italian ethnicity, heritage language retention is rare. Even Canada’s large Ashkenazi Jewish population, which continues to be religiously and cul- turally distinct from the population at large, has nearly lost its linguistic distinctiveness: native speakers of Yiddish are now a small minority. A sim- ilar fate has befallen the other major linguistic communities of the pre-war migrations: native speakers of Ukrainian, Polish, Dutch and the Scandina- vian languages are now comparatively rare, except among the much smaller numbers of new immigrants from the countries where those languages are spoken.
The process of assimilation is inexorable, gradually defeating the best efforts of those in the minority communities who try to prevent it among their children; the most that can be achieved is a slight delay of one or two generations. Indeed, the very concept of pure ethnolinguistic communities surviving beyond one or two generations in the liberal, pluralistic, egalitarian context of modern Canada’s cities is essentially absurd: prolonged survival could only be effected by a rigid ethnic separatism, which would be perceived by most people today as narrow-minded or even bigoted, much as it might appeal to the more traditional values of some immigrant communities. Even official sponsorship in the form of a federal ministry of multiculturalism (now subsumed in a Department of Canadian Heritage) has had little effect on long-term assimilation, despite millions of dollars spent. It has achieved little more than symbolic value in a propaganda campaign designed to estab- lish a multicultural “mosaic” as the basis of Canadian national identity, in

2.6 Immigration history and Canadian English 99
self-conscious contrast to the “melting pot” ideology that prevails (or used to prevail) in the United States.
Notwithstanding the beliefs of Canadian nationalists, cultural and lin- guistic assimilation has followed similar paths in the two countries. Even the major exceptions to it are broadly parallel: the fishing communities of New- foundland and North Carolina’s Outer Banks; the Hassidic Jews of Montreal and New York City; the German-speaking agricultural communities of the Amish in Pennsylvania and the Mennonites in Manitoba; the Aboriginal communities in Canada’s North and the American Southwest; the large Chinese communities of Vancouver and San Francisco. Moreover, Canada’s official linguistic duality is becoming less of a distinguishing feature as the Spanish-speaking community in the United States grows in numbers and influence. This has generated, if not an official, at least a de facto bilingualism in some American cities exceeding that in many Canadian ones: there is much more Spanish spoken in Los Angeles, San Antonio and Miami (or even New York and Chicago) than French in Vancouver, Calgary and Halifax.
At a general level, multiculturalism in both countries is a function not of national culture or government sponsorship but of recent immigration pat- terns: New York City is no less multicultural than Toronto, while Newfound- land and Saskatchewan are no more so than Maine and North Dakota. Multi- cultural diversity is perpetuated not by the segregation and non-assimilation of older immigrant groups, but by the constant renewal of the immigrant population by newly arrived groups, who modify its character. For the older groups, assimilation is the rule: especially for the majority of Canadian- born children of immigrants, the lure of an English-speaking North American popular culture is irresistible. Nevertheless, a by-product of lin- guistic assimilation in areas where the concentration of particular ethnic groups is strongest has been the development of ethnic varieties of native English that differ from majority speech in subtle ways, like the Montreal example discussed in Chapter 5, Section 5.3. These have perpetuated at least a vestige of linguistic distinctiveness for the groups concerned and have greatly enriched the character of the affected varieties of English.
2.6 Immigration history and the development of Canadian English
So far, it has been asserted that Canadian English owes its very existence to three of the most important historical events in the rise of the modern world: the British victory in the Seven Years’ War; the American Revo- lution; and the Industrial Revolution in Britain. The first of these secured Canada as a British possession, while the second two peopled it with Amer- ican and British immigrants, respectively. It remains to be seen how the sources of this immigration determined the linguistic character of Canadian English.

100 Canada’s English-speaking population
In the case of Newfoundland English, this relation is quite clear. As discussed above, the source regions of British and Irish immigration to Newfoundland were very specific: the great majority of settlement came from southwestern England and southeastern Ireland within a relatively short period of about half a century. Moreover, Newfoundland itself is fairly small and its communities have remained comparatively isolated from any subsequent changes that might have been introduced by successive phases of settlement, which has made the problem of tracing the origins of Newfoundland speech less complex that it might otherwise be. Many features of contemporary speech in St. John’s bear an obvious relation to features of contemporary southern Irish English: for example, the relatively retracted and rounded quality of the vowel in strut; the relatively open, low-central quality of the vowel in lot; the relatively front and raised quality of the vowel in start; the use of dental stops in place of interdental fricatives in thin and this; and the occurrence of fricativized final /t/ in get (Hickey 2007: 328–332). That said, it was argued in Chapter 1 that traditional Newfoundland English cannot be considered a Canadian variety in any meaningful sense, so that extensive discussion of it will be left to other works with a specific Newfoundland focus. For an examination of Irish influence on Newfoundland speech, the reader is therefore referred to Clarke (2004c), Hickey (2002, 2007: 407–409) or Kirwin (1993).
Explaining the origins of features of mainland Canadian English in terms of immigration history and settlement patterns is much more difficult than the case of Newfoundland. Perhaps the dominant view of this question can be referred to as the Loyalist Theory, discussed in Section 1.6 of Chapter 1. Bloomfield (1948) and Avis (1954), in trying to explain the largely North American character of Canadian English, appealed to the history of Loyalist settlement discussed above in Section 2.2, suggesting that this established a basic pattern for Canadian English that was only superficially altered by subsequent immigration from Britain, in accordance with the doctrine of first effective settlement put forward by Zelinsky (1973). Scargill (1957) took issue with this view, arguing that it oversimplified the origins of Canadian English, giving too much weight to the Loyalist contribution and too little to other factors, particularly the British immigration of the nineteenth century.
There can be no question that the arrival of the Loyalists had a huge impact on the future of Canada: they contributed substantially to the settlement of Nova Scotia and their large settlements in present-day New Brunswick and Ontario led directly to the creation of those provinces. Their conservative culture of loyalty to the British crown and mistrust of revolutionary republi- canism was arguably the seminal influence on what was to become the Cana- dian national identity, even if that identity emphasizes somewhat different values today. For many decades after their arrival, leading Loyalist fami- lies formed the governing elites in several Canadian communities, founded institutions and established social patterns. However, it is less certain what

2.6 Immigration history and Canadian English 101
impact the Loyalist immigration had on the formation of Canadian English, because comparatively little is known about exactly where the settlers came from or how they mixed with each other in new communities, much less how they spoke when they arrived.
To begin with, the fact that most of the Maritime settlers arrived from New York City says very little about their speech, since Loyalists from all over the American colonies had found shelter there. Brown and Senior (1984: 30–31) offer a regional breakdown of the refugees arriving in each Canadian region. In New Brunswick, 70 percent came from the middle colonies (40 percent from New York and 22 percent from New Jersey), 22 percent from New England (13 percent from Connecticut and 6 percent from Massachusetts) and only 7 percent from the southern colonies. In Nova Scotia, 50 percent came from the middle colonies, 30 percent from the southern colonies and the remaining 20 percent from New England. In Quebec, the initial point of entry for many of those who later went to Ontario, the “vast majority” came from New York, with much smaller numbers from Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Those who went directly to Ontario could be assumed to have originated mostly from the middle colonies rather than from eastern New England or the South, as suggested by Avis (1954: 15, 1973: 46) and Chambers (2006a: 388–389). The middle colonies – New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania – were then the predominant source of early Canadian English, but not to the exclusion of other regions. Moreover, even if we assume a predominance of immigrants from the middle colonies, the Mid- Atlantic region today is home to several distinct dialects of American English: in fact, the North–Midland boundary between New York and Pennsylvania, which cuts it in half and divides northern from southern New Jersey, is perhaps the best-known product of American dialectology (Kurath 1949: Figures 3 and 5a; Kurath and McDavid 1961: map 2).
A further difficulty is that, even if it can be established that refugees from one former colony or another predominated in some section of British North America, this information is still of limited use in establishing the roots of Canadian English. While the majority of the Loyalists were of English ethnic origin, there were also many Scots and Germans, as well as several thousand Aboriginal people and African Americans. The ethnic diversity of the refugees is demonstrated by the fact that the Upper Canadian townships were segregated by ethnic and religious affiliation. The first five Royal Townships, granted to former members of the King’s Royal Regiment of New York, were settled by Catholic Highlanders, Scottish Presbyterians, German Calvinists, German Lutherans and Anglicans, respectively (Brown and Senior 1984: 49). Though most of the Loyalists were American-born (up to 90 percent in New Brunswick, somewhat less in Nova Scotia (Brown and Senior 1984: 31)), it is far from clear what sort of English any of these groups might have spoken, if they spoke English natively at all. Even many of the American-born may have been first-generation Americans living in

102 Canada’s English-speaking population
isolated frontier communities that had little or no exposure to the linguistic norms of Boston, New York or Philadelphia.
Notwithstanding these difficulties, we can agree with Chambers (2006a: 383) that the basic difference between the types of English heard today in the former British colonies of Australia and New Zealand and in the former North American colonies is due in large part to the different histories of British emigration to the southern and northern hemispheres. It reflects in particular the fact that the southern hemisphere colonies were settled mainly in the nineteenth century, after certain changes had taken place that now characterize Standard Southern British English (Trudgill 2004), whereas the northern hemisphere colonies were first settled in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, before those changes had taken place. This accounts for two of the major differences between Standard British, Australian and New Zealand English, on the one hand, and most dialects of North American English, on the other: the split of Middle English short /a/ into short and lengthened classes with backing of the lengthened vowel to /ah/ (e.g. staff, bath, pass and cast); and the vocalization of /r/ in non-prevocalic contexts, such as dark and four (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2, for an explanation of the pronunciation features discussed here). These features became general in southeastern British English after the initial settlement of North America: Lass (2006: 89) suggests /a/ was lengthened in the eighteenth century and backed to modern /ah/ in the nineteenth (though Wyld (1925: 203) suggests an earlier date), while general loss of /r/ became common in the eighteenth century (Lass 2006: 92). The influence of American Loyalists on the foun- dation of Canadian English probably established the earlier forms – an unre- tracted vowel in staff and constricted /r/ in dark, etc. – as the future standard of Canadian English. Other important features of Canadian English may also have their roots in Loyalist settlement, to the extent that some regions of the United States from which Loyalists emigrated exhibit those features today. For instance, the low-back merger (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2.1) is found in eastern New England and western Pennsylvania (Labov, Ash and Boberg 2006: 58–65), while “Canadian” raising of /ay/ and /aw/ (Section 3.2.3) is found on Martha’s Vineyard, off the Massachusetts coast (Labov 1963; 1972: 1–42), and raising of /aw/ in eastern Virginia (Kurath and McDavid 1961: map 29). These correspondences do not, however, rule out the possibility of later, independent developments on each side of the border. Indeed, the prevalence of unmerged low-back vowels and unraised /aw/ in many of the places the Loyalists came from, including New York City and Philadelphia, argues for later, independent developments.
An important difficulty in attributing features of modern Canadian English to Loyalist settlement was pointed out by Scargill (1957: 611): many of the features we now think of as North American in Canadian English might just as well have descended from various regional types of British English, not via American colonial populations but directly, either in the speech of the

2.6 Immigration history and Canadian English 103
earliest British immigrants to Canada, a few of whom predated the Loyalists, or in the speech of the first great British migration of the nineteenth century, which so greatly outnumbered the Loyalists. The discussion in Section 2.3 made it clear that only a minority of the British migrants to Canada would have spoken the southeastern dialects on which the modern British standard is based, and which have so close an affinity with the speech of Australia and New Zealand. Most British immigrants came instead from northern and western England, Scotland and Ireland, regions whose speech, to this day, has more in common with Canadian English (and many varieties of American English) than the speech of the London region.
If we examine the distribution of the four Canadian features just mentioned – unsplit /æ/, retained postvocalic /r/, the low-back merger and raised /aw/ – in the regional dialects of modern British English as described by Wells (1982), we find that unsplit /æ/ (trap = bath) is shared with northern England, Scotland and Ireland; retained postvocalic /r/ (in start, north, etc.) with southwestern England, Scotland and Ireland; the low-back merger (lot = thought) with Scotland and parts of northern Ireland (though Chambers (2008: 11–13) argues against this derivation); and raised /aw/ (mouth), though not the allophonic pattern of Canadian Rais- ing, with Scotland. The possible origin of Canadian Raising in British input dialects has been dismissed, at least in the case of /ay/, by Gregg (1973: 142), who denies Scottish or Scots Irish influence, but Trudgill (1986: 159) suggests that raised forms of /ay/ spoken by Scottish and other immigrants to Canada may have been mixed with unraised forms spoken by immigrants from other regions, so that new generations of Canadian children resolved the conflict by developing an allophonic alternation between the competing forms (Britain 1997 suggests a similar origin in dialect mixture for Canadian Raising in East Anglia). A fifth defining feature of Canadian English identi- fied by Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006: 224) is monophthongal or peripheral variants of /ey/ and /ow/: Wells indicates such pronunciations of f a c e and goat in Yorkshire, Scotland and Ireland.
It must be admitted that the representation of vowels in the British dialects discussed here has been oversimplified (see, for instance, Beal 2004, Stuart- Smith 2004 and Hickey 2004 for more detailed discussions of the vowels of northern England, Scotland and Ireland, respectively). Furthermore, it is somewhat simplistic to assume that modern British dialects are the same in these respects as the dialects of nineteenth-century emigrants from these regions that might have influenced Canadian English. Nonetheless, it may not be coincidental that most of the distinctive features of Canadian English are also found, to some extent, in some or all of the regions of the British Isles from which most British immigrants to Canada came in the nineteenth century. Affording an equal place in the formation of Canadian English to British regional inputs would also accord with its mixed lexical character,

104 Canada’s English-speaking population
which shows American and British influences as well as unique Canadian forms, as discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.1).
Whatever might have been the mixture of American and British influences in the establishment of the basic sound pattern of Canadian English, it seems likely that this pattern was firmly in place in most of Ontario and parts of the Maritimes by the middle of the nineteenth century. In this position, it came to be identified with English Canadian culture. Over the course of the following decades, it expanded with that culture to most of the remaining regions of the country, in some cases through the migration of Ontarians themselves to new regions, like the Prairie West, in other cases through less direct channels, like schools and other institutions. Though it was pointed out in Section 2.4 that Ontarians and other Canadians were only one of four groups in the mass migration that peopled western Canada, they may have had a greater role than the other groups in establishing local speech patterns by virtue of their identification with English Canadian culture, a kind of domestic standard to which groups with lesser local social status might have assimilated. In the emerging West, American and British speech would have been perceived as foreign in a way that Ontario English was not. If Chambers (2006a: 385) states the case for Ontario influence somewhat more strongly than it is stated here, the spread of Ontario English to western Canada during the Land Boom must have had an important part to play in the development of the comparative pan-regional homogeneity that characterizes Canadian English today, at least between Vancouver and Ottawa (see also Trudgill 1986: 146).
Nevertheless, as with the earlier case of Loyalist influence, it should be emphasized that many of the features of western Canadian English might just as well have originated in the regional dialects brought to the West by British and American immigrants. Indeed, in addition to the similarities between Canadian and regional British English mentioned above, Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006: 146–147) find that Canada and the American Midland and West form a group of highly similar dialects of North American English that are difficult to separate in clear-cut ways: a principal components analysis of twenty-one vowel measures finds these three regions to be directly adjacent in a scattergram. Ontario influence can hardly be adduced as an explanation for these similarities. Rather, it seems likely that the whole of Canada and the western United States form a broad zone of dialect leveling, in which features of various Atlantic American and – at least originally – British regional dialects were intermingled by mixed groups of settlers under similar circumstances, with a great deal of cross-pollination caused by inter-regional migration. Trudgill (1986: 146) discusses this type of leveling as a historical influence on Canadian English, while Kerswill and Williams (2000) and Kerswill (2003) show how it can lead to homogenization even in older dialect areas, like England. Some of the features of western Canadian English, then,

2.6 Immigration history and Canadian English 105
might just as well have crossed the border with immigrants from very similar- sounding regions of the western United States, or crossed the ocean with Scottish immigrants, as come from Ontario on the Canadian Pacific Railway. It seems most likely that both sources had at least some influence in shaping the speech of the half of the country that was settled following Canadian Confederation.
Once Canada had been settled from Victoria to Halifax, it seems safe to suppose that future arrivals of new immigrants, however numerous, would have had relatively little influence on Canadian speech, especially as these immigrants came increasingly from non-English-speaking lands. Their chil- dren, once they started school, acquired local speech patterns that were by then firmly established as the majority dialect of each community, just as they do today. Any substrate effects in their parents’ second-language English, or foreign features in non-Canadian native varieties of English, would have been lost within one or two generations. The massive scale of immigration in modern Canada, filling entire neighborhoods with people who speak languages other than English and French, raises the possibility that future developments in Canadian English may indeed reflect the multi- ethnic and multilingual character of urban Canada, beyond the obvious level of loanwords for ethnic foods and other cultural phenomena. Nevertheless, it should be recalled that, as noted in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, the proportion of immigrants in Canada’s cities and in the country as a whole was even higher in the 1920s and 1930s than it is today, yet these huge foreign-born popula- tions apparently had little influence on the development of Canadian English. Their descendants today are linguistically indistinguishable from those of the Loyalists and earlier British immigrants. So it may be for present and future generations of Canadians with non-Canadian origins, however numerous they may be, but a strong upward shift in levels of immigration could alter this forecast, as suggested in Chapter 6.

3.2 Canadian English pronunciation 141
almost all respondents using /ow/ in process and two-thirds favoring /ow/ in progress, but 71 percent using /o/ in produce. Another variable set of words is adjectives and nouns in <-ile, like fertile, futile and missile, which have /-ayl/ in SBE, as in profile, but /-əl/ in SAE, so that futile sounds like feudal and missile rhymes with thistle. In this set, Ontario usage tends again to follow the British model, with the full vowel in docile, futile, senile and virile, but diverges in the case of fertile, with a small majority favoring the American form (Avis 1956: 46). A similar divergence is recorded by Scargill and Warkentyne (1972: 64), Nylvek (1992: 272) and Woods (1999: 226), who show a large majority using the American form of missile, which may reflect the dominant place of American English in the semantic domain of war and weaponry in the late twentieth century. Otherwise, Woods’ data on Ottawa English tend to show more British influence than those of Avis, with almost exclusive use of the British form of futile (1999: 214) and with a majority, which actually increases in apparent time, favoring the British form in fertile (1999: 213). A third group of words examined by Avis is the combining forms anti-, multi- and semi-, which have /iy/ in the second syllable in SBE but can have either /iy/ or /ay/ in SAE, depending partly on the word they are combined with. Both Avis (1956: 47) and Woods (1999: 201, 228, 236) show British /iy/ to be the strongly dominant form in Canada.
It is in variables of phonemic incidence, then, rather than in variables of phonemic inventory, that British influence can be seen in Canadian English. This is possibly the result of American forms having been deliberately dis- couraged by anglophile school teachers and textbooks, at a superficial level of grammar where the difference between the competing forms could be readily understood by the general public, but it may also reflect heavy British settlement in Canada during the nineteenth century, as discussed in Chapter 2. Whatever its cause, British influence on phonemic incidence in Canadian English has been selective and inconsistent, as demonstrated by the further examples in Table 3.11, which presents a sample of the remaining miscellany of phonemic incidence variables examined in successive surveys of Canadian English. Data from four of these studies are compared in the table; some of the variables have also been included in Chambers’ Dialect Topography project and in the Canadian Index of Linguistic Insecurity of Owens and Baker (1984: 341), among other studies. Most of the variables involve single words, being essentially random and unsystematic and there- fore of little interest to theoretical linguists. They are not, however, without iconic value or sociolinguistic import: they reflect the shifting and uncer- tain allegiances of English-speaking Canadians to the two main historical influences on their language and culture.
The first thing to observe about the data set in Table 3.11 is that it contains relatively few cases of clear, categorical differences between British and American English: often, British forms are given by American dictionaries as acceptable alternatives, presumably indicating their use by at least a minority

Table 3.11 Ten miscellaneous variables of phonemic incidence in Canadian English, with their usual variants in Standard British and American English and their status (where available) in four surveys: Avis (1956), Scargill and Warkentyne (1972: 51–71), Gregg (2004: 50–64) and Woods (1999: 199–244). The variable portion of each word is underlined; alternative variants are given in order of preference or frequency. Majority responses are shown for the Canadian surveys, in some cases even where usage is fairly evenly divided; split indicates an even split between two variants.

            of Americans. Only in the case of lieutenant is there a categorical difference, and in this case the majority of Canadians favor the American term, despite the long military association between Canada and Britain. In fact, this seems to be the general pattern: while there are a few instances of Canadian usage following a British model in individual surveys, like Gregg’s report of leisure with /e/ rather than /iy/, most of the variables display a Canadian propensity to adopt American rather than British pronunciations, like the consistent finding of either with /iy/ rather than /ay/ as the majority form. However, other cases might be adduced to show the opposite alignment, such as the strong past form of shine: shone rhymes with bone in SAE but with gone in both SBE and SCE (Avis 1956: 50; Zeller 1993: 184; Chambers 1994: 45–46). Moreover, some American regional variants are rarely heard in Canada, such as route with /aw/, from Table 3.11, or roof and root with short /u/ rather than long /uw/ (Avis 1956: 50).
To the variables of phonemic incidence already discussed might be added the evidence of several more variables that show the alignment of Cana- dian English with American rather than British phonology. One is the set of words in <-ary>, like library, secondary and secretary, or in <-ory>, like circulatory, laboratory and mandatory, which have reduced or deleted vowels before <-ry> in SBE but full vowels in SAE and in SCE. Another variable is stress assignment in loans from French, like ballet, cachet, cafe ́, frontier, garage, massage, paˆte ́ and souvenir, as well as in women’s names in /-iyn/, like Christine, Colleen, Eileen, Kathleen, Maureen and Pauline. These words all have initial stress in SBE but final stress in SAE and SCE (see also Trudg- ill and Hannah 1985: 42–43). On the other hand, Latin-derived verbs in <-ate>, like frustrate, rotate and vibrate, tend to have final stress in SBE

3.2 Canadian English pronunciation 143
but initial stress in SAE and SCE; though the stress pattern is different, the dialect division is the same.
3.2.4 Phonetic variation
As important as the variables in Table 3.11 may be as targets for the corrective efforts of schoolteachers or as matters of concern for Canadian cultural nationalists, in practical terms they have only a minor influence on the sound of Canadian English, since the chance of their occurring in any particular sample of speech is fairly small. Like variation in the actual words people use (couch vs. chesterfield or sofa), variation in the sounds that occur in particular words (route being homophonous with root or rout) loses its symbolic value for both speaker and audience if the relevant words do not happen to arise in conversation. By contrast, phonetic variation, which will be defined here as systematic variation in the sounds of phonemes independent of their lexical context, plays a powerful role – perhaps the most crucial role of all – in allowing speakers to project their regional identities and audiences to assess and react to those identities. What matters for regional identification in everyday speech, then, is not so much whether one says couch or chesterfield, or whether one has the vowel /aw/ in route, but how one pronounces the vowel /aw/, or some other vowel, in the entire set of words that contain it. (As was already mentioned in connection with variation in phonemic inventory in Section 3.2.1, regional differences in the phonetics of North American English mostly involve vowels rather than consonants.)
While many studies of phonetic variation have made effective use of audi- tory impressionistic analysis, recording and conveying the analyst’s impres- sion of vowel quality with detailed phonetic symbols, standard practice in the study of regional and social variation in vowel production has now shifted to computerized acoustic analysis, as in Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006). This will be the method adopted here. It is based on the demonstration by Peter- son and Barney (1952) that the quality of English vowels can be accurately and precisely represented by measuring the frequency in Hertz of the first two formants in the acoustic spectrum associated with vowel production. In particular, they showed that the first formant (F1) is inversely corre- lated with vowel height and the second (F2) directly correlated with vowel advancement (see also Hillenbrand, Getty, Clark and Wheeler 1995). These principles were first applied to the large-scale analysis of dialect differences and ongoing change in vowel production by Labov, Yaeger and Steiner (1972). Since acoustic phonetic analysis is now a standard procedure, it does not warrant further explanation here; readers who are unfamiliar with this method are referred to an introductory phonetics textbook for the requisite background knowledge.
An acoustic study called the Phonetics of Canadian English (identified here- after as PCE) was undertaken by the author at McGill University between

1999 and 2005. Its results were reported in Boberg (2005a; 2008a), which can be consulted for full methodological details. It involved sociolinguistic inter- views with 108 McGill undergraduate students from across North America, selected to represent the major dialect regions identified by Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006), as well as the traditional historical and cultural regional divisions of Canada. The regional sample will be used here to develop a nationwide view of SCE in contrast to American varieties, with references to regional differences only where they complicate the national view; detailed discussion of regional differences will be reserved for Chapter 5. The PCE participants provided demographic data about themselves, then read a list of 180 words, then carried on spontaneous conversation with the interviewer, a fellow student, for 30–45 minutes.
The PCE interviews were recorded on cassette tape, then digitized at a sampling rate of 22 kHz and analyzed acoustically, using both spectrographic analysis and linear predictive coding (LPC), in the CSL 4400 program pro- duced by Kay Elemetrics, the same used by Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006). The method of acoustic measurement was also the same as that of the Atlas of North American English, a correspondence guaranteed by the principal analyst in the two projects having been one and the same person: the author.

Table 3.12 Data for Figure 3.1: mean F1 and F2 measurements (and standard deviations) for vowels and allophones of Standard Canadian English (interregional mean of 86 participants from eight Canadian regions)
     within the nucleus of each vowel. This was the maximum value of the first formant (F1) in the case of vowels whose central tendency is vertical aperture, or a point of inflection in the second formant (F2) in the case of vowels whose central tendency is the movement of the tongue toward, then away from, the front or rear periphery of the vowel space (such as ingliding vowels). Where the nucleus featured a protracted steady state in the values of both formants, a measurement was made within that steady state. The measurements thus obtained were then normalized using the additive point system of Nearey (1978), again as in Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006), in order to eliminate sex- related differences in formant values due to variation in vocal tract size. The data on vowel production presented here are taken from the 145 items on the word list that were selected to represent the normal phonetic range of all of the vowel phonemes of English, with extra representation of allophonic contexts of particular interest. The means for each vowel and allophone are given in Table 3.12 and displayed graphically in Figure 3.1.
Figure 3.1 and Table 3.12 present a balanced, interregional mean of eight regional means: those for British Columbia, the Prairies and northwest- ern Ontario, southern Ontario, Greater Toronto, eastern Ontario, Quebec, the Maritimes and Newfoundland. An interregional mean, in which each

146 Principal features of Canadian English
region has equal weight, prevents the national picture from being skewed by the number of participants from each region. Each regional mean is in turn a mean of the individual mean measurements from each participant in the region, with an average of ten participants per region, or eighty-six Canadian participants in total (the regional sample is discussed further in Chapter 5). Formant values for each participant are means of the values of all of the words chosen to represent each vowel or allophone (an aver- age of six words per vowel or allophone). Figure 3.1 and Table 3.12 are therefore an abstraction developed for comparative purposes. While many aspects of this vowel system are common to most speakers of SCE, this is not the vowel system of any single region of Canada, much less of any individual (for examples of individual vowel systems, see Chapter 5, Section 5.5). It serves instead as a national average against which the systems of particular regions or individuals can be compared and which can itself be compared to the vowel systems of SBE and SAE, which is the aim of this section.
The vowel system in Figure 3.1 and Table 3.12 contains all of the vocalic phonemes of SCE listed in Table 3.6, except for /iw/, which has nuclear formant values similar to /uw/, being distinguished by its preceding palatal glide rather than by its nuclear quality. The double low-back merger indi- cated in the system was confirmed by t-tests of differences between the mean F1 and F2 values for each pair of vowels for each speaker. The system also contains three of the prerhotic vowels listed in Table 3.8; the others are omitted, since they involve regional variation in the application of condi- tioned mergers. Finally, it shows several important allophones as separate analytical categories: /æ/ before front nasals (N) and /g/; /ay/ and /aw/ before voiceless obstruents (T) and elsewhere; /aw/ before /n/; and /uw/ and /ow/ before /l/ and elsewhere. As can be seen in the chart, these allo- phones are phonetically distinct from the more general qualities of their respective phonemes and are analyzed separately so as to prevent skewing of the main distribution. The short vowels in Figure 3.1 are indicated with black circles, the front upgliding vowels with triangles, the back upgliding vowels with squares and the long monophthongs with Xs. As before, keywords from Wells (1982) are given in Table 3.12 except where allophonic distinctions not made in Wells need to be indicated.
Figure 3.1 displays most of the phonetic characteristics used by Labov, Ash and Boberg to establish “Inland Canada” – from Edmonton to Toronto – as a distinct dialect of North American English (2006: 224, map 15.7). The first of these, also extending to Vancouver in the west and to Montreal in the east, is the Canadian Shift, a lowering and retraction of the front short vowels /i/, /e/ and /æ/ first identified by Clarke, Elms and Youssef (1995). The Canadian Shift appears to be initiated by the retraction of /æ/, first described in Vancouver English by Esling and Warkentyne (1993), which is in turn activated by the low-back merger of /o/ and /oh/, a well-established feature

3.2 Canadian English pronunciation 147
of Canadian English listed among the variables of phonemic inventory in Table 3.5. As /æ/ shifts down and back into the low-central space made available by the merger, /i/ and /e/ shift down and inward in parallel fashion. The original formulation of Clarke, Elms and Youssef emphasized lowering of /i/ and /e/ to fill the space created by the retraction of /æ/, a classic chain shift, while a subsequent study of the shift in Montreal English by Boberg (2005a) emphasized parallel retraction, finding the F2 of /e/ to be the variable that showed the strongest movement in apparent time. Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006: 221) and the apparent-time analysis presented here in Chapter 5 (Figure 5.3 and Table 5.12) find significant effects of speaker age on both the F1 and F2 of /e/, suggesting that the shift involves both lowering and retraction of that vowel.
In keeping with the latter view, Figure 3.1 shows /i/ in upper-mid position opposite /ey/; /e/ in lower-mid position near the raised allophones of /æ/; and /æ/ approaching low-central position, [􏰐a], well separated from the /ah- o-oh/ double merger in the low-back quadrant. The mean formant values for these vowels in Table 3.12 all conform to the thresholds established by Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006: 219) for the shift: the F1 of /e/ is greater than 650 Hz; the F2 of /æ/ is less than 1,825 Hz; and the F2 of /o/ is less than 1,275 Hz. It is the Canadian Shift, more than any other feature of Canadian English, that supports the identification of Inland Canada as a separate dialect region in the Atlas of North American English (Labov, Ash and Boberg 2006: 130). This is particularly true along the border between southern Ontario and the American Inland North, where the phonemic status of /o/ and /oh/ is in direct contrast (Zeller 1993: 188), motivating opposite developments of the low vowels /æ/ and /o/ (Boberg 2000). In the Inland North, the tensing and raising of the entire old short /a/ class as /æh/ – the initiating phase of the Northern Cities Shift – allows the distinction between /o/ and /oh/ to be maintained through the advancement of /o/ into the low-central space. In Ontario, the merger of /o/ and /oh/ allows /æ/ to retract into the same space that is occupied by /o/ across the border. As a result, the phonetic quality [a] corresponds to different phonemes in each country: to /o/ in Detroit and Buffalo, where lot is pronounced [lat]; but to /æ/ in Toronto, where trap and bath are pronounced with [a]. In southeastern Michigan and western New York, [hat] is the opposite of cold; in Ontario it is something you wear on your head. The Michigander’s pronunciation of solid sounds like salad to Canadians, while the Canadian’s rendering of rack sounds like rock to the Michigander (see Willis 1972 for an experimental investigation of dialect differences in perception of /e/, /æ/ and /o/ along the Ontario–New York border).
The next two defining features of Inland Canada in the Atlas concern the mid upgliding vowels /ey/ and /ow/: these are relatively more peripheral and less diphthongal in Canada than in most American dialects. The PCE data in Table 3.12 almost satisfy the Atlas criterion for peripheral /ey/,

Linguistic Resistance on the Maine-New Brunswick Border
WENDY BURNETT
Mount Allison University
The Canadian Atlantic Provinces, as a region, have not been the subject of intensive linguistic research. Kurath’s linguistic atlas of the United States and Canada project, for example, includes only a handful of respondents from north of the border. However, two major studies establish the area as a separate dialect region. The Survey of Canadian English (Scargill and Warkentyne 1972) reveals that the responses of grade nine students and their parents in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island vary from their peers in central Canada and the western provinces. More recently, the Atlas of North American English (Labov et al. 2006), using data from the Telsur Project, a telephone survey of respondents in North American urban centres, also indicates the existence of a separate dialect region in the Atlantic Provinces.
1. THE NEW BRUNSWICK STUDY
Since Scargill and Warkentyne’s 1972 Canadian survey, published investigations of New Brunswick English have been rare. They include A. Murray Kinloch’s front vowel studies (1975), William Davey’s study of fronting in an idiolect in Harvey Station (1985), Kinloch and Fazilah’s study of Canadian Raising of /au/ in Fredericton (1993), and a study on convergence (Burnett 2001). Unpublished studies include investigations conducted by Bateman (1975), who compares the responses of University of New Brunswick students to those of the grade nine students on the Survey of Canadian English, and Miller’s (1989) border study comparing the English language in Calais, Maine, and St. Stephen, New Brunswick.
New Brunswick is not a site that lends itself easily to studies of linguistic diffusion. On the one hand, it has a small population (approximately 729,500) scattered around the periphery of a large area (73,440 sq. kilometres). On the other hand, its geographical location on the eastern periphery of Canada makes it relatively isolated. These factors
I would like to thank Jack Chambers for his valuable comments in the preparation of this paper.

make a traditional interview-based exploration of linguistic innovations on a province-wide basis both time-consuming and logistically difficult.
Figure 1 shows the location of the two principal language groups within the province. Anglophones, who make up approximately 65 percent of the population, predominate in the southern half of the province. Francophone communities are generally found in the north and along the northeast coast. There are no major urban centres. The two largest communities, Moncton and Saint John, have census areas of about 125,000 each; the capital, Fredericton, has a population of 48,000. The centre of the province is forested, as are the province’s borders with Maine and Que ́ bec.

begun in 2001 and completed in 2003—now makes it possible to explore in greater detail several of the linguistic changes observed elsewhere in Canada. For reasons mentioned above, the geo-demography of the province favours the use of a postal questionnaire as a data-gathering tool, and thus lends itself nicely to the methods of Dialect Topography (Chambers 1994, 1998a). The postal questionnaire was first used in Canada by Scargill and Warkentyne (1972) for their survey of Canadian English, and then by Gregg in the Kootenay region of British Columbia (1973), and by Zeller for her Toronto-Milwaukee studies (1990, 1993). The Dialect Topography version has now been applied in the Golden Horseshoe (Chambers 1998a, 1998b; Panster 2001), the Ottawa Valley, Montreal (Boberg 2005), Que ́ bec City (Chambers and Heisler 1999), New Brunswick, the Eastern Townships, and currently, in its internet form, in the Vancouver area.
In New Brunswick, the 76-item Dialect Topography questionnaire was sent to approximately 900 residents over the age of 14 in every region of the province: 758 of the questionnaires were returned, 284 of them from respondents between the ages of 14 and 19. For the purpose of a comparison study, the survey also included 104 participants from the adjoining Eastern New England dialect region, including 27 high school students and 34 residents over the age of 19 from the border town of Calais, Maine, and 43 university students from Maine, New Hampshire, and eastern Massachusetts.
2. LINGUISTIC VARIABLES
In order to determine how New Brunswick fits into general trends that have been observed in other regions, we focus on responses for 16 variables that were identified in the Golden Horseshoe as having significant differences at the Canada-United States border (Chambers 1998b). These variables allow us to determine similarities and differences in the two Canadian regions and also to discover whether they are comparable in the two border areas.
Table 1 lists the 16 variables with their predominant Canadian (and American) variants. The third and fourth columns show comparative results for teenagers (14 to 19 years old, the youngest respondents in the Dialect Topography surveys), with the Golden Horseshoe results from Panster’s survey (2001) that was carried out closer to the time of the New Brunswick survey.
This list includes five lexical variables (athletic shoes, sink knob, cloth for washing, soft drink and evening meal), and ten pronunciation variables (shone, anti-, vase, semi-, Z, asphalt, lever, avenue, Mom, and progress). The remaining variable, the deletability of motion verbs with locative particles,

3. ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES
What jumps out from the figures in Table 1 is the consistency for many of the responses given by the teenagers in the two regions, and this notwithstanding the 1,000 or more kilometres that separate them, to say nothing of differences in degree of urbanization, population density, and ethnic diversity. Added to that, these particular variables were chosen because they have well-established and common variants. Yet the responses of these teenagers are within five percentage points of one another for five variables (anti-, semi-, Z, asphalt, soft drink), and within nine percentage points for two others (shone and avenue). This consistency is yet another example of the homogeneity of middle-class, urban Canadian English that has been remarked upon informally for almost a century. This linguistic homogeneity is the most striking fact that emerges from the comparison of large, representative samples of adolescents, the most capricious age group, not necessarily urban or middle-class (though predominantly so, because they are representative of the general population), and separated by great distances.

BURNETT 165
Although these groups display a remarkable degree of linguistic homongeneity, it is not this fact that makes the greatest impression, partly because differences tend to attract the eye more than similarities. For example, one discrepancy between the two groups is the high percentage of New Brunswickers who say sneakers. An examination of the responses for the older age groups makes it clear that sneakers has been the established New Brunswick standard for some time: 71.4 percent of the respondents over the age of 80 use that form, a sharp contrast to the Golden Horseshoe preference for runners/running shoes in all age groups. Adding to this discrepancy is the fact that, although sneakers is tagged as an Americanism in the Golden Horseshoe and most other parts of Canada, the state that neighbours New Brunswick, namely Maine, shows a lower frequency of sneakers than the other American states in the Dialect Topography which include New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. For this variable, New Brunswick is unique, picking up a variant that is at odds not only with the Golden Horseshoe but all Canadian regions so far studied.
Another item where the two groups show a considerable discrepancy concerns the word for the evening meal: it is dinner in central Canada but supper in New Brunswick, with dinner a minority response at less than ten percent. In this respect, New Brunswickers appear to be more conservative than their inland age-mates. Dialect Topography results for the Golden Horseshoe indicate that the word supper was replaced as the name for the evening meal starting in the 1940s and that it survives mainly in the speech of older and rural groups.
A general comparison of the responses by the two groups indicates that, on the whole, younger New Brunswick speakers are changing more slowly than their southern Ontario peers. Excluding sneakers, when we compare the responses of the 14–19 age groups, we see that younger New Brunswick speakers are more likely to say tap, zed, facecloth, wants out, asphalt with [$], lever with [ij], Mom with [ç], and progress with [A] than are their Golden Horseshoe counterparts. The distinction reflects a broader trend: comparisons across all the regions show that New Brunswick teenagers retain these forms more often than 14- to 19-year-olds in the Golden Horseshoe, Ottawa, Montreal, Que ́bec City, and the Eastern Townships.
Thus, New Brunswick teenagers appear to be more linguistically conservative than their counterparts elsewhere in Canada. But in comparison to their elders in New Brunswick, young people are agents of change. This reflects the fact that the linguistic conservatism of a particular group can only be measured relative to another group. Figure 2 shows the results for the whole New Brunswick sample for six of the variables. It compares the age groups from the octogenarians on the left

166 CJL/RCL 51(2/3), 2006
 Figure 2: Change in progress for six variables in New Brunswick
(over 80) to the teenagers on the right (14–19), with the others arranged by decades in between.
The general trend in the figure is obviously upward, with the teenagers showing an increase in the use of what is the minority variant for older speakers. Five of these variants, as we have seen, have been identified as American shibboleths, that is, they are cogent markers of nationality. For example, at the Niagara border Z as zee is an American stereotype, and shone with [o], anti- with [aj], lever with [E], and avenue with final [u] are less well-known but generally stable differences. In all these cases, the trend in Figure 2 shows relative stability in the older speakers, symbolized by the flat line, with a slight upturn for the 30-year-olds and an accelerating increase for the 20-year-olds and teenagers. The remaining variable, progress with [A], has considerable presence in New Brunswick even among the oldest speakers, and a check of Scargill and Warkentyne’s survey (1972:67) shows that New Brunswick had the highest incidence of this variant in all of Canada even 30 years ago. We now know that the situation persists: not only is the old standard maintained, but there is also a steady and accelerating upward climb that has been going on for four decades.

BURNETT 167
4. THE AMERICAN PRESENCE
The increasing use by New Brunswickers of variants used in the United States by speakers under the age of 40—or, conversely, their decreasing use of Briticisms that were imported into Canadian English by the influx of British immigrants in the middle of the 19th century (Chambers 2004)— corroborates an earlier study of language trends in New Brunswick with variables such as l [Ef]tenant/ l [u]tenant, l [i]ver/ l [E]ver, sneaked/snuck, and eavestroughs/gutters, where the first variant of these pairs was shown to be losing ground to the second variant (Burnett 2001).
Further evidence of this trend comes from Boberg’s investigation of ‘‘foreign A,’’ the split between /æ/ and /A/ in loanwords like Iraq, Mazda, pasta, taco, and Vietnam, in which Canadians tend to choose [æ] and Americans choose [A]. Boberg (2000) showed that young speakers in the Atlantic Provinces under the age of 40 choose [A] in sharp contrast to older speakers, to the extent that there is an 800 percent increase in preference for the American vowel as compared to speakers over the age of 60. Boberg points out that the dramatic increase in the use of the American /A/ by younger New Brunswickers cannot be explained by settlement history or the gravity or wave models of diffusion (2000:22).
As mentioned earlier, the demographics and geography of the province, made up largely of non-urban scattered communities, do not provide an obvious setting for geo-spatial diffusion of linguistic variants. Although many New Brunswickers travelled to the small city of Bangor, Maine, for cross-border shopping a generation ago when the Canadian dollar had a higher value than the American greenback, young people today make the pilgrimage to the malls in Moncton and Saint John. With the exception of the border crossing at St. Stephen, a small town in the southwest of the province, there is diminished interaction with the United States. Given the absence of direct contact, it is difficult to explain the convergence towards American forms, conservative though it may be by comparison to other Canadian regions studied to date.
5. THE BORDER STUDY
Borders are notoriously complex, linguistically and in many other ways; no matter how permeable they may seem, they are still barriers of a sort. Data from neighbouring border towns in New Brunswick and Maine indicate that proximity counts for much less when there is a political border between neighbours.
The Dialect Topography of New Brunswick includes respondents from the town of St. Stephen, New Brunswick, and the town directly across the border, Calais, Maine, the most important border-crossing in the

168 CJL/RCL 51(2/3), 2006
Maritimes (Fig. 1). The towns are separated only by a short bridge and share a number of community services such as a movie theatre, a civic centre, and a fire department. High school students in the two communities interact with one another in social, academic, and athletic activities, and the pattern of cross-border interaction carries on for older members of the communities, many of whom shop, work, and sometimes marry across the border. These interactions, moreover, have been sustained without a noticeable rift for several generations.
With such communal feeling, it is all the more surprising that our results do not reveal strong convergence towards American forms that might be expected from younger people in a border town; in fact, our investigation reveals significant resistance toward American forms.
Table 2 provides results with respect to the 16 variables already discussed in Table 1, but this time the comparative data come from St. Stephen and Calais, flanked by their larger affiliations, New Brunswick and Maine, for further comparison. Table 2 differs from Table 1

by counting the predominant New Brunswick variants, identified as the New Brunswick standard, rather than the central Canadian standard. This change affects the percentages with respect to athletic shoes, which are sneakers, and evening meal, which is supper, in effect recording them as the converse of the variants counted previously. One minor change from the previous table shows the result for vase as the percentage of the two principal Canadian variants, [vAz] and [vez], whereas Table 1 showed only the results for the latter variant, which is the major one in New Brunswick and thus affords a point of contrast with central Canada. Here, both variants are counted because they contrast—sharply it turns out, as in all the other border communities we have looked at in the Dialect Topography project so far—with the results across the United States border.
When we look at the results for these variables, we can discern five cases with the status of Canadian-American markers. Moreover, the relative weight of that status differs in the adjacent towns of St. Stephen and Calais. In the discussion that follows, we distinguish them as (1) Canadian-American markers, (2) markers with St. Stephen influence on Calais, (3) markers with Calais influence on St. Stephen, (4) markers with reciprocal influences, and (5) non-markers. We summarize these cases at the beginning of the next section and attempt to determine their social significance.
Table 2 reveals strong retention in St. Stephen of Canadian standard forms for four of the variables: sink knob, vase, cloth for washing, and soft drink. In all of these instances, use of the Canadian variant in St. Stephen is high (69 percent or more), matching high percentages in the province as a whole, and that variant is almost non-existent in the neighbouring state, including Calais. The variants used in New Brunswick are also the main ones used in central Canada, where they also mark Canadian-American differences.
Among the other variants that show a sharp distinction between St. Stephen and Calais are five that not only reinforce Canadian-American differences (as they also do elsewhere) but also suggest potential influence flowing, at least mildly, across the bridge from St. Stephen into Calais. These variables are lever, Mom, evening meal, avenue, and progress. In all of these instances, the St. Stephen response is decisive, remarkably so in the first three variables (75 percent or more, and categorical for supper). What distinguishes these from other variables is that, in all five, Calais speakers use a higher proportion of the St. Stephen variant than do people in other parts of the state. This is probably not accidental, or mere coincidence. The presence of the Canadian variant in the immediate region apparently provides a model for some people in Calais, and it will take a real-time replication to determine if the minority variants are snuffed out in years to come or gain critical mass.

170 CJL/RCL 51(2/3), 2006
When we look for correlative cases—variants that have higher frequency in St. Stephen than in the rest of New Brunswick, and thus might be inferred as Calais influences—we find only one instance that appears to fit. For the letter Z, more than half of the St. Stephen teenagers use the American variant zee, almost 20 percent more than the provincial norm. The Calais teenagers use it almost categorically, as expected, about the same proportion as elsewhere in the state. It seems reasonable to infer that the St. Stephen teenagers are influenced by American usage in this instance.
A couple of instances that at first appear to be Calais influences turn out, on closer inspection, to be reciprocal instead, or at least arguably so. In the analysis of shone and asphalt, the Calais influence definitely registers in St. Stephen, but there appears to be some counter-influence as well. In the Golden Horseshoe, these two variables, shone and asphalt, are shibboleths. So they are in New Brunswick as compared to Maine, where shone with [A] occurs for two-thirds of New Brunswickers but for no Mainers outside of Calais. When we look narrowly at the border region, the proportions are mitigated in both St. Stephen and Calais, with a significant drop in the former (16 percent) and a small showing in the latter (seven percent). Similarly, asphalt with [$] contrasts sharply in New Brunswick (73 percent) and Maine (zero percent), but the difference is much less dramatic in the border towns, with St. Stephen a bare majority (56 percent, a drop of 17 from the rest of the province) and Calais a fairly hefty 16 percent, which must make quite an impression when Calais citizens visit other parts of the state.
Another variable showing reciprocal influence in the border towns is wants (to go) out. The results show the border difference clearly (with New Brunswick about 66 percent higher than Maine), but St. Stephen shows a fall from the New Brunswick norm and Calais shows a rise from the Maine norm so that the difference is not quite so striking (though St. Stephen is 50 percent higher than Calais).
There remain certain variables that are not Canadian-American markers at the New Brunswick border at all, even though they are elsewhere. Instead, they appear to be established on both sides of the border. One of these is semi-, and the results show that the final vowel is usually [ij], not [aj], in Maine as it is in New Brunswick (both around 86 percent) and also in Calais as it is in St. Stephen. Oddly, together the two border towns form a little trough where the minority form [aj] occurs much more frequently than elsewhere (by about 20 percent). The variable anti- shows almost the same pattern of frequency on both sides of the border, and again Calais and St. Stephen form a trough, but the [aj] variant shows up much more strongly in all regions. If the lower frequencies mark a change in the direction of [aj] in anti-, which in

BURNETT 171
central Canada is the American variant, the change might be expected to affect semi-, which is similar to it both phonologically and morphologically.
The remaining variable that crosses the border without prejudice is sneakers, and Table 2 shows that it is the majority form on both sides of the border. There is no evidence that its occurrence on the Canadian side is an outcome of Americanization, as central Canadians might assume based on its status as a shibboleth in their region. On the contrary, the higher percentage of St. Stephen 14–19-year-olds using sneakers compared to their provincial peers (87.5 to 82 percent) might be construed as an indication that the St. Stephen teens are asserting their difference from the Calais teens, since, as mentioned earlier, the state of Maine uses sneakers less than any other state in the Dialect Topography surveys, and Calais follows the state norm in that regard. Further analysis shows that females in New Brunswick use sneakers more than males, the targeted market for athletic footgear. Young New Brunswickers in general use sneakers less often than any age group below the 60–69-year-olds, and its use by older people shows that it has been the standard term for many years. Young people in the larger centres with access to major shopping malls use more alternative forms such as trainers, kicks, joggers, cross trainers, and tux. For now, and probably for a long time to come, sneakers is the standard term on both sides of the border.
6. AUTONOMY AND SOLIDARITY
The data from the New Brunswick Dialect Topography survey clearly indicate that convergence to American forms need not occur in a situation in which geo-linguistic diffusion might be expected. Table 3 summarizes the disparate results indicated by the distribution of the variants of these 16 variables at the border. Instead of converging, younger speakers in the border town of St. Stephen show evidence of strong or growing resistance to American forms on nine of the 16 variables investigated. In most of these cases, the St. Stephen teenagers maintain norms found elsewhere in their province. With four variables, they actually accelerate their usage of the marker as compared to their peers elsewhere in the province. Two are relatively infrequent, vase and progress, but the other two, pop and supper, occur with fairly high frequency and would undoubtedly make an impression under ordinary circumstances.
Similar observations arose in the analysis of responses at the Niagara border in the Golden Horseshoe, where the most proximate regions (Welland and Niagara Falls) usually had high frequencies of the marker and occasionally the highest in the whole sample (Chambers 1994:45).

172 CJL/RCL 51(2/3), 2006
Like the St. Stephen residents, respondents in this area appear to be actively resisting assimilation or, put positively, asserting their identity in an aggressive, albeit subtle, manner. One of the functions of borders, obviously, is to separate people into groups according to some criterion, in these cases political ones, and it is not surprising to discover that border dwellers behave like the front line of defence.
Our analysis shows that younger speakers in Calais sometimes adopt Canadian forms. Because the sample is limited, we cannot ascertain the significance of this finding. What is clear is that the movement toward forms used in St. Stephen is at least as strong as any detectable movement in the opposite direction. Results like these cast doubt on the Canadian fear of American absorption, which was promulgated a few years ago in linguistic articles with titles like ‘The Americanization of Canadian pronunciation’ (Clarke 1993) and ‘A synchronic study of English spoken in Ottawa: Is Canadian English becoming more American?’ (Woods 1993). Those articles are now more than a decade old, suggesting that the old inferiority complex is waning. Dialect Topography may have played a part. Any time we have had enough good data from border points to come to grips with the linguistic situation, the simplistic notion that Canadians are allowing themselves to be

subjugated by their neighbours has fallen flat (Chambers 1998b:238). The case study presented here is far removed from previous ones in terms of demography and sociology, and the point is clear that linguistic autonomy persists.
Boberg’s 2000 study of geo-linguistic diffusion makes it possible to compare the border situation of St. Stephen with that of Windsor, Ontario. Like the citizens of St. Stephen vis-a`-vis Calais, people in Windsor have frequent and intensive contact with people in Detroit. In spite of this interaction, their vowel systems, or at least those of the two speakers interviewed for the Telsur Project, are distinctively Canadian. The hierarchical influence that one might anticipate as a result of the proximity of Detroit is non-existent.
Boberg cites the Canadian vowel system itself as a factor in the resistance to the Detroit forms. However, attitudes also come into play. Chambers and Trudgill discuss the crucial role played by ‘‘autonomy’’ in determining resistance and acceptance of linguistic innovations (1998: 9–12). In most parts of the world, people live in dialect continua, such that neighbours have dialects and accents more similar to those who live close to them than to those who live farther away. When national boundaries are superimposed upon these continua, neighbours across the border from one another continue to speak mutually intelligible dialects, but they are distinguished from one another by their apperception of autonomy. In the case of St. Stephen and Calais, we would expect that St. Stephen citizens consider themselves Canadians, read Canadian newspapers, listen to Canadian newscasts, and otherwise ‘act’ Canadian, even to the point where linguistic changes that are standardizing will be in the direction of standard Canadian English. Similarly, Calais citizens consider themselves Americans and ‘act’ American in all the expected ways. Autonomy is best known as a concept in sociology of language, but it could well be applied in micro-sociolinguistic studies.
Chambers and Trudgill (1998) also use the term ‘overt stigmatization’ to characterize reluctance to adopt forms which may lead to disapproval. It seems likely that such stigmatization is not a fixed value but one that fluctuates with social circumstances. We have noticed that, if anything, St. Stephen appears to be influencing Calais linguistically right now, at least as much as and probably more than vice versa. Recent socio- demographic studies indicate that Canadians and Americans are thinking less and less alike on many moral and political issues (Adams 2004). One can speculate, therefore, that younger speakers in St. Stephen may be more sensitive to the social implications of adopting forms they hear across the border in Calais, Maine, and perhaps the converse is at work as well.

Canadian English (1857)1
The Reverend A. Constable Geikie
It is a growing opinion that the English tongue is destined to become, for many purposes at least, the language of the world. But supposing such an extension of our vernacular to be probable, will the world speak "English undefiled," or English very defiled indeed? I know nothing of the tendencies in Australia, New Zealand, or at the Cape; but certainly, the English we often hear spoken, and see written, in the United States and Canada, is by no means an improvement on the original. That the American retains some obsolete words, or uses current words in obsolete ways, cannot fairly be objected to,2 though the very same reasons justify the language of modern Quakerism.3 But this process will account for a small fraction of the peculiarities of his language. He is daily inventing words which are neither English in character, nor needed to supply any deficiency in the language; and even where peculiar circumstances may make such a coinage, or such perversion of words from their primary significance pardonable, the circumstances are continually disregarded, and they are applied in cases where no such need exists, to the exclusion of the proper phrase, and to the injury of the language.
Canada inevitably partakes of the same influences. Her language is largely affected by such lawless and vulgar innovations. New words are coined for ourselves by a process similar to that which calls them into being in the neighbouring States; still more, they are imported by travellers, daily circulated by American newspapers, and eagerly incorporated into the language of our Provincial press. The result is that, with that alacrity at sinking which belongs to human nature, we are in a fair way of appropriating what is worthless in the word coinage of our neighbours, in addition to all which our peculiar position may generate among ourselves.
1A. Constable Geikie, a Presbyterian minister and writer, immigrated to Canada from Scotland in 1843 at age 22. He read this paper before the Canadian Institute on March 28, 1857; it was published in the same year in the Canadian Journal of Science, Literature, and History, pp. 344-55. Geikie is thought to be the first scholar to name and describe “Canadian English.”—Eds.
2 Early British immigrants to North America brought some words (e.g., gotten, past participle of get) that subsequently fell into disuse in Standard British English. —Eds.
3 When the Quaker movement began, in the 17th century, ye was a plural pronoun as well as a singular form used to show respect (cf. vous in contemporary French). Thou was used only with those of those of equal or lesser rank (cf. tu in French). Being adamantly egalitarian, Quakers avoided ye singular and used thou with everyone. By the end of the 18th century, you had become the all-purpose 2nd person pronoun in Standard British English, but many Quakers continued to address others as thee and thou throughout the 19th century. — Eds.

 Canadian English (1857), A. Constable Geikie

It is not necessary to attempt any methodic classification of words or phrases; the purpose of this paper will be sufficiently accomplished by noticing a few of the most characteristic novelties as they occur to me. Neither shall I make any distinction between obsolete words and modern inventions. It is enough if it can be shown that words, unrecognized by good authors, are daily used; that words duly recognized are used in improper ways; or that extraordinary creations, and combinations of letters and phrases, are extensively circulated without supplying a recognized want, or contributing in any sense to the enrichment of the language. To refer, then, to a few examples of such transatlantic innovations on the English language: when Englishmen wish to mark their sense of the services of some public personage, by a suitable testimonial, they are said to give or present something to him, and the thing so given or presented is called a gift or present. But with us it is becoming fashionable to speak of such a gift as a donation, and still more of a thing donated. A minister is, with peculiar delicacy, dragged up before two or three hundred people and, a band of music, to receive a present from his congregation, of a horse, it may be, or a purse of money--and this gift, dubbed a donation, is donated to him at what is called a donation-meeting. Webster says, that donation is usually applied to things of more value than presents; but while such may be true in the States, I have known it applied here to a basket of musty cakes. I suppose that donation has a certain meaning in law. Its most ordinary English application is to a single gift in money, in contra-distinction to the periodical payments of a fixed sum as subscription. When applied to a present, public or private, I apprehend such an application of the term has its origin in mere pomposity. The language stands in need of no such expression so long as we have our old Saxon gift.
In England, when one man accommodates another with the use of money for a time, he lends it. The sum is called a loan, but he who provides it is said to lend or to have lent. Here, however, it is becoming usual to speak of having loaned to another. Webster says that to loan is rarely used in England, and I may say that I never heard it there. What advantage then does it possess over the more familiar form of the verb that it should supersede it here? Surely the phrase "money to lend," is sufficiently intelligible. To talk of loaning money, would suggest to an unsophisticated Englishman, the idea of some unknown process at the mint.
Again, let a clergyman study his sermon, a professor his lecture, a member of Parliament his speech, or a merchant the state of the markets and the rate of exchange: an educated or uneducated Englishman would probably say, "the man is master of his subject," and than this, more need not and cannot be said. In the States and Canada, however, a new phrase is current. A member of our Assembly makes a luminous speech, say about that great institution of modern civilization, the gallows-- and writers forthwith remark that "he is posted-up on it." A Professor of Anatomy gives a lecture on some abstruse branch of his department of medical education, and his admiring pupils exclaim that "he is well posted-up on his subject." A metaphysician once more grapples with the old problem how many angels can stand on the point of a

needle, and he, too is posted-up on it." A clergyman is posted-up in theology, a blacksmith in iron, a milliner in crinoline, a mother in nursery government, and an undertaker in the art of "performing" funerals, and coffining his customers. But, while ledgers may and should be "posted," it has not hitherto been the English practise to treat men so, unless they be black-legs.4
A man in England possesses notable capacity, and people style him capable, or able, or great. In Canada he is designated first-class. To speak of a first-class carriage, or a first-class prize, or even a first-class ox, may be right enough, but why apply phrases with such poor associations to men of splendid intellect? Is it not enough that a man be great? Will he seem any greater when indissolubly associated with a railway van? The originators of such expressions no doubt thought so, but if the victim of such a nick name be what it is supposed to imply, he will not thank his admirers for the compliment.
A man in Britain buys a house, or farm, and it is said in, or more precisely, situated in such a street, or district, or county. Here, nobody or thing is situated anywhere; all are located. Our farms, our houses, our congregations, our constituencies, all are located. We admire a mansion occupying a healthy, or commanding site, and we are told that "the location is good"; a clergyman is congratulated on his incumbency, which is styled a comfortable location; and so on ad infinitum. To locate is a purely technical term, belonging to land-surveyors and their profession, and it is difficult to perceive any gain to the language by its application being extended beyond its original technical significance.
Ask an Englishman how much he has accomplished of a given work, and he will reply if getting on well, "a good deal." Ask the same question in our own colony, and if in a like position, the answer will be, "considerable." Now, considerable means, "worthy of consideration." Thus: "a man has a considerable fortune." We can understand when, in answer to the question, "How are you getting on with your mathematics?" the student replies considerable, or, still more elegantly, "considerable much." He means to say, "very well" and it is to be regreted that he should not say so. Or to give another specimen of the novel mode of applying this word considerable, a newspaper editor recently illustrating by comparison the telegraph-cable designed to unite Canada with the States, by being laid in the bed of the River St. Clair, from Detroit to the Canadian shore, says of it: "It is larger by considerable than the Atlantic submarine cable."
A man concludes a bargain, and he resolves on a certain course of action. A man also comes to a conclusion after having considered a matter. But there is a difference between coming to a conclusion and resolving. To do the former, merely implies that he has formed an opinion, to do the latter implies that he has determined on a course of

 Canadian English (1857), A. Constable Geikie

action. So we understand it, and so the words are used in English literature. But it is becoming common in Canada to confound conclude and resolve, and to speak of conclusions when resolutions are intended. Thus, "I conclude to go," is put for, "I have resolved or made up my mind to go"; surely a very needless confusion of ideas or vocables.
A territory is defined by Webster5 to be "a tract of land belonging to, or under the dominion of a prince or state, lying at a distance from the parent country, or from the seat of government." It is also used for the whole lands belonging to any kingdom or state. On this continent, it is often applied in its first signification, thus, "the territory of Wisconsin," and indicates then, either all the lands of a state or nation, or certain distant or outlying possessions. Region and district again indicate a portion only of a kingdom, province, or territory. But a district may indicate a very minute portion of a state, county, or even of a city; whereas a region describes so wide an extent of country, as almost to be synonymous with that word. Beginning, then, with the former, we say district means the smallest measure, territory a large measure, and region the largest of all. But in the States and Canada, the three words are often confounded; territory is put for region, and region for district, until neither word has any exact or specific meaning left. It is inevitable, indeed, in a new country, settled under peculiar circumstances, so different from those of the mother country, that new terms should be devised. Hence our Gores, Townships, Concessions, broken-fronts, water-lots, &c. But all of these are definite, universally understood with the same significance, and so contribute to the precision of language, instead of detracting from it, and as such, some of them at least, will be permanently incorporated into the English language.
People who speak English, say of a jury when it returns to court, and expresses its judgment, that "it renders its verdict," and this act is called "the rendering of a verdict," or technically "a finding." All this appears intelligible, and we are slow to imagine anything plainer. But people who, whatever their shortcomings, try to speak the language of Swift and Addison, are little aware of the progress of the age. With many among us, juries never render verdicts, but make rendition of them; and such, in lieu of speaking of a finding or rendering, refer to what they style a rendition, a mode of expression which, whatever it may be, is not English in such a connection. There is such a word as rendition, but it means surrender or yielding possession, it is a diplomatic, or law term, more than anything else. Let us apply the true meaning of the word to the action of a jury. Thus, "The jury returned to court in the course of half-an- hour, and surrendered or yielded possession of their verdict." I submit that such bodies of men give, or express, but do not surrender opinions. Indeed, one would like to know how any man could surrender an opinion? A man may make rendition of his property,
5 Noah Webster, in his American Dictionary of the English Dictionary (1st edition, 1828), rewrote and supplemented existing British dictionary definitions of English words to reflect American meanings. Webster’s implicit acceptance of the divergence of Amercian English from British disturbed even some of his fellow American patriots. — Eds.

but he only expresses his sentiments. As the men of Derry said, so say I, "no surrender." But the most absurd use of this abused word may be illustrated by its mode of introduction in a newspaper notice of a concert recently given in Toronto. The writer seems to have been pleased with some tune, and he accordingly speaks of "the beauty of its rendition." Musical people do speak in a certain sense of "rendering tunes," but the author of this critique has the honour of originating the idea of a tune being capable of rendition. The unsophisticated reader would be sorely tempted to ask how in all the world a man could surrender a tune?6 Doing so implies a measure of coercion. But can a singer be forced to sing, or even, having done so, does he thereby surrender the tune? By force you may take the notes out of his hand, but how can you take them out of his throat?
In England it occasionally happens that great offenders are hanged, but in the States and Canada, criminals are never hanged; they are all hung. In England, beef is hung, gates are hung, and curtains are hung, but felons are hanged; in Canada, felons, beef, gates, and curtains are all treated in the same way.
But our English is not only wayward and independent, it is also so exceedingly modest, that we are in danger, not only of altering our vernacular, but of forgetting how our bodies are constructed. If we know anything of English conversation or letters, we speedily find out, even if stone-blind, that British men and women have both arms and legs. But in Canada, a stranger who could not see, would find it difficult to discover much about our conformation. He would learn that both sexes had limbs of some sort, but from any information which our language would give, he could not tell whether their limbs were used to stand on or hold by.7
Among British domestic fowls there are many styled gallinaceous; and among these are cocks and hens, male and female. But a blind naturalist could never fancy that we have the same distinctions in Canada. He would, indeed learn that we have hens; but he would wonder in vain what had become of their mates. That there existed an unknown creature called a rooster, he would early discover, but unless he made particular enquiry, he might return after a year's residence among us, thoroughly convinced that there were no cocks in the province. Still greater, perhaps, would be his surprise, on making the discovery, to learn that in using the old familiar English name for the hero of the barn-yard, he had been using a very immodest word. This sort of thing is preeminently disgusting, and speaks ill, not merely for the taste, but for the morals of those with whom such a refinement originated. In Canada, such a garment as trowsers is unknown. What do we wear? Pantaloons is the reply; or more familiarly pants, with
6 Although Geikie accepts two meanings of the verb to render, “to hand over or surrender” and “to repeat (something learned), to recite” (Oxford English Dictionary), he associates the derived noun form, rendition, only with the first meaning. — Eds.

the feminine elegancy pantalets! But is this the fact? Certainly it is not. At least it has never been my fortune to meet with one in this country who wore them. Pantaloons are an article of dress, out of fashion for fifty years. In more familiar vernacular they were wont to be called skin-tights, and while answering a similar purpose, are very different from trowsers in their shape.8 The origin of such a misnomer is sufficiently obvious. Such prudish euphemisms are by no means peculiar to Canada or the States. They find their complete parallel in the English synonyms: unmentionables or inexpressibles, and the like familiar shibboleths of immodest prudery, which belong exclusively to no class or county, but are none the less to be avoided by all who would regulate their mode of thought and expression by purity and true refinement.
In England, good housewives and the lieges at large, are sometimes horrified by the apparition of a loathsome insect, yclept a bug. Gardeners also find creatures of the same genus on their plants, and zoologists are familiar with numerous varieties of them. But, however great the variety, and however diverse the habits of different species, few words associated with insect life are so universally avoided, or are, from certain associations, more revolting than this monosyllable. And yet, we hear people on this side of the Atlantic, who, to say the least of it, are quite as familiar with this insect- pest as those on the other, -- applying this nauseous title to the beautiful firefly which makes our fields so glorious on a warm summer night. Canadians call it the "lightning- bug!" Here, we have, not simply an abuse of language, but a breach of good taste, which it might be thought no person of refinement could ever perpetrate. As well might they dignify a vase of sweetly scented roses by making it share with the offensive and suffocating missile occasionally employed in naval warfare, the euphonious epithet of "stink-pot!" Moreover as this term bug is universally employed both in Canada and the States as a synonym for insect, the further result is a loss of precision, such as, in the commonest use of terms at home, discriminates at once between a fly, a beetle, and a grub. In England the term fly also applied occasionally to a light vehicle, and it is on the same principle I presume that a four wheeled gig receives here the elegant name of buggy!
Turning again to another class of words; there is a curious disposition manifested among our manufacturers of improved English, to convert our regular into irregular verbs, for the sake of gaining what some modern grammarians have styled the strong preterite. In England, when a swimmer makes his first leap, head foremost, into the water he is said to dive, and is spoken of as having dived, in accordance with the ordinary and regular construction of the verb. Not so however, is it with the modern refinements of our Canadian English. In referring to such a feat here, it would be said,
8 For Geikie, pantaloons or pants were probably “tight trousers fastened with ribbons or buttons below the calf or (later) with straps passing under the boots, which superseded knee-breeches and became fashionable amongst men in the late 18th and early 19th cent” (OED). Pants in contemporary British English is underwear; thus, Canadians who make nonchalent reference to their pants are likely to raise eyebrows in Britain. — Eds.

not that he dived, but that he dove. Even Longfellow makes use of this form, -- so harsh and unfamiliar to English ears, -- in the musical measures of his Hiawatha:--
"Straight into the river Kwasind Plunged as if he were an otter, Dove as if he were a beaver," &c.
As we say drive, drove, driven, we may look for the completion of the verb to dive, on its new model, and find the next poet's hero having "diven as if he were a beaver" or any other amphibious native of the new world. Though as yet unsanctioned by such classic authority, the verb to give not unfrequently assumes among us the past form of he guv, rose becomes ris, chid -- chode, delved -- dolve, helped -- holp, or holped, swelled -- swoll, &c. Yet so lawless and systemless are the changes, that, along with such alterations, which might seem to aim at a universal creation of strong preterites, we have the process reversed, and froze becomes freezed or friz, felt-feeled, &c. That some of these are as yet mere vulgarisms is not to be denied, but when the older examples receive the sanction of the highest literary authorities we may reasonably dread that the adoption of the remainder is a mere question of time.
When an Englishman speaks at random or without sufficient authority, he guesses. When he expresses an opinion, he thinks. Guess and think are not synonyms, but refer to two opposite states of mind. Far otherwise is it in the neighbouring republic, and with too many here; for, with Americans and their imitators, guess and think have an identical signification, A "Clear-grit" guesses that the person beside him who does not spit on the floor, is a tory and a contemptible aristocrat, while a tobacco-moistening "Hoosier" guesses, and for like reasons, that a Boston merchant must be a federalist. Now if they only knew it, neither of these discerning and refined individuals guesses at all. Contrariwise, each feels confident in the matter pronounced upon. The general conduct of the persons of whom they thus judge, together with the subdued action of their salivary glands, has satisfied both that the political tendencies of the others must be the antithesis of their own. They are in no uncertainty, and a guess is impossible. The ordinary American use of this word justly subjects its users to ridicule, unless the precision which our English tongue once boasted of is no longer a feature worth preserving.
But a volume might be written about the evils glanced at here. In closing this paper, therefore, I can only indicate a few more of the indigenous elegancies which are already meeting with such general acceptance, and thereby corrupting, not simply the speech of the Province, but such literature as we have. It cannot, we fear, be justly affirmed that such expressions as the following are so entirely confined to the vulgar and uneducated as to be undeserving of notice as an element likely to affect permanently the language of the Province:

"Are you better to-day?" inquires Britannicus. "Some," replies Canadiensis. "Were there many people present?" asks B. "quite a number," answers C., meaning thereby "a number," for how can a number be otherwise than quite a number?
B:-- "Where did you go today?" C:-- "down town," that is, he walked through, or in the city.
B:-- "are you going by this train?" C:-- "yes, I'm just on board."
B:-- "where is your master?" C:-- "the boss is out."
B:-- "how many horses have you?" C:-- "a span," which word he substitutes for "a
pair ."
B:-- "what is that man's character?" C:-- "he's a loafer," that is, in plain English, "a good for nothing fellow."
B:-- "how do you vote?" C:-- "I go the Hincks ticket."
B:-- "has there been a committee meeting?" C:-- "yes, they had a caucus last night." B:-- "can that wheel revolve now?" C:-- "yes, I guess it can do nothing else, for I've fixed it."
B:-- "did you mend my shoe." C:-- "yes, I've fixed it."
B:-- "when will your sister be ready?" C:-- Jane is just fixing her hair."
B:-- "what do you eat to venison?" C:-- "jelly fixings."
B:-- "what have you done with your other horse?" C:-- "I've dickered him."
B:-- "what kind of a speaker is W--?" C:-- "a stump-orator."
B:-- "how did he get his present office?" C:-- "by chiseling."
B:-- "is there much jobbing in the house?" C:-- "no end of log-rolling."
B:-- "did he run away?" C:-- "yes, he sloped,” or "he made tracks."
B:-- "how do you feel to-day?" C:-- “I'm quite sick."
B:-- "sick! why don't you take something to settle your stomach?" C:-- "my stomach isn't unsettled. Its my toe that aches!" &c.
Nor is it in solitary words or phrases alone that we are thus aiming at "gilding refined gold," in our improvements on the English language. So far has this process already been carried that it would not be difficult to construct whole sentences of our Canadian vernacular which, to the home-bred ear, would stand nearly as much in need of translation, as an oration of one of the Huron or Chippeway Chiefs whom we have supplanted from their ancient hunting grounds on the shores of the great lakes. Let us take a brief example. A Canadian who has enjoyed the advantages of the American vocabulary will thus describe a very simple transaction:-- "I traded my last yorker for a plug of honey dew, and got plaguy chiseled by a loafer whose boss had dickered his lot and betterments for notions to his store;" some of the words introduced here are genuine Americanisms, such as betterments, i.e. improvements on new lands; lot, or division of land; town lots, sites within the area designed for a village or town; boss (Dutch) the euphemism for the unpalatable word master; and store, the invariably term for a shop. Others again, such as yorker: a shilling york currency, or sixpence sterling, are no less genuinely Canadian; and the whole, will become intelligible for the first time to the inexperienced English ear when thus translated:-- "I exchanged my last sixpence
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader
51

for a packet of tobacco, and got thoroughly cheated by a disreputable fellow whose employer had bartered a piece of improved land to obtain small wares for his shop."
These and a thousand other examples which might be produced, fully justify the use of the term "Canadian English," as expressive of a corrupt dialect growing up amongst our population, and gradually finding access to our periodical literature, until it threatens to produce a language as unlike our noble mother tongue as the negro patua, or the Chinese pidgeon English. That the English language is still open to additions no one can doubt, or that it assimilates to itself, when needful, even the racy vernacular of to-day, to enrich itself, where synonyms are wanting. Hence, whenever a single word supplies the place of what could only be formerly expressed by a sentence, -- unless the word be singularily uneuphoneous, -- the language gains by its adoption. But if chiseling only means cheating; and long-rolling, -- jobbing; and clearing out, or making tracks, -- running away; then most men of taste will have little hesitation in their choice between the oldfashioned English of Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, and Addison, and such modern enrichments of the old "well of English undefiled." Such words-of-all-work, again, as some, and quite, and fix, and guess, having already a precise and recognized acceptance in classical English, it is probable that good writers and educated speakers will still recognize them in such sense, and when they fix a wheel immovably, they will say they have fixed it; but when they mend of repair the same wheel, they will find no inconvenience in using one of the latter terms as equally apt and less ambiguous. And so also when they make a guess at some fact beyond their certain knowledge they will say so; but when they speak of what they actually do know, they will state it as a fact, and not guess about it.
An amusing illustration of the manner in which such misuse of words can obscure the sense of their true meaning even in the minds of educated men, is furnished by a critical comment in the "Shakespear's Scholar," of Richard Grant White, A.M.,9 on the following passage in "Richard III." Act IV, Scene IV:--
Stanley.
K. Richard.
Stanley.
K. Richard.
Richmond is on the seas.
There let him sink--and be the seas on him. White livered runnagate;--what doth he there? I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess. Well, as you guess?
A better illustration of the correct use of the word could now where be found. Stanley says he does not know, he only guesses; and the king replies; well tell me what your guess or suspicion is. But hear the American critic:-- "If there be two words for the use of which, more than any others, our English cousins twit us, they are 'well,' as an interrogative exclamation, and 'guess.' Milton uses both, as Shakespear also frequently

does, and exactly in the way in which they are used in America; and here we have them both in half a line. Like most of those words and phrases which it pleases John Bull to call Americanisms, they are English of the purest and best, which have lived here while they have died out in the mother country." To such "English of the purest and best! " are we fast hastening, if some check is not put on the present tendencies of our colloquial speech, and the style adopted in our periodical literature.
It may be assumed that enough has now been said to shew the truth of the complaint with which this paper began. How then is the evil to be remedied? One or two suggestions occur to me which may not seem unworthy of some attention, as means calculated to check in some degree this growing evil. The first is that, educated men in private stations should carefully guard against the errors indicated, and others germane to them, and use their influence to check them when introduced. The second is, that our common school teachers should not only do likewise, but should correct the children under their care, whenever they utter slang or corrupt English, not only in the school, but in the play-ground, and on the streets; and the third is that, our newspaper and other writers should abstain from the attempt to add new force to the English tongue by improving the language of Shakespeare, Bacon, Dryden, and Addison. It is true that these are antiquated names; and it may be that some among us rather know them by the hearing of the ear than the sight of their works; still, weak though it may seem, and -- to cull once more, for the sake of illustration, one of the choicest phrases of Canadian letters, -- "old fogyish" though it may appear, I cannot get rid of the impression, that those men understood English fully as well as any American or Canadian author, and that, though they never wrote slang, no one either on this side of the Atlantic, or on the other, has written, or is likely to write, either with augmented force, or greater clearness.

CANADIAN EH?: A SURVEY OF CONTEMPORARY USE Elaine Gold
University of Toronto, Queen's University
1. Introduction: Previous Research on the Use of Eh
Although eh is widely considered to be a marker of Canadian speech, there has been little research done into its use or meaning and none in the last 25 years. During the 1970's there was a brief burst of interest in eh. The 1972 Survey of Canadian English included the following two questions regarding eh:
(1) Do you use eh in, e.g., So that's what he thinks, eh?
(2) Do you use eh for What did you say?
That same year Avis wrote an article entitled 'So eh? is Canadian, eh?' in which he argued against eh being a Canadianism, citing examples of eh from English writings around the world. However, he undermined his own argument, in that he could find only Canadian examples of two types of eh: the narrative eh illustrated in (3), and eh used as a reinforcement of an exclamation in (4):
(3) "He's holding on to a firehose, eh? The thing is jumping all over the place, eh, and he can hardly hold onto it eh? Well, he finally loses control of it, eh, and the water knocks down half a dozen bystanders." (Avis: 103)
(4) "How about that, eh?" (Avis: 99)
Love's 1973 B.A. thesis, from Edmonton, included a survey of the use of
eh with declaratives, imperatives, exclamations, wh- and yes-no questions, based on Avis' examples. Gibson's 1977 PhD thesis, from Vancouver, proposed an eight-fold categorization of eh based on Avis' work that was then used in two subsequent surveys: the Survey of Vancouver English (1977, 1980) and the Ottawa Survey of Canadian English (1980).

Gibson's categories are shown on the left of Table 1; the corresponding survey questions are shown on the right. Gibson's descriptions of polarity refer to the polarity that would be reflected in standard tags, as I have indicated in the square brackets after the sample sentences.
This paper focuses on the results of a survey of eh usage conducted on students at the University of Toronto. Section 2 presents the questions and format of the survey used. Section 3 gives the results for respondents who are Canadian born, have English as their first language and are under 30 years of age. These 2004 results are then compared in Section 4 with the results of the earlier surveys mentioned above. Results for recent immigrants are discussed in Section 5 and compared with the results of Canadian born speakers. Respondents' comments about eh are presented in Section 6 and my findings are summarized in Section 7.
2. Questionnaire: Questions and Format
The questions used in the 2004 survey are shown in Table 2. These questions were based on those used in the Ottawa and Vancouver surveys with one deletion and five additions. The questions new to the survey are indicated with an asterisk. The imperative sentence in Table 1 has a confrontational tone and so a second example of command was added. Two fixed expressions were added: Thanks, eh? which had also been added to the Vancouver survey, and I know, eh? on the suggestion of several students. Based on Johnson's (1976) claims that eh could be used with insults and accusations, an example of each was added. The sentence Oh, you're still here, eh? was eliminated as it seemed to combine the categories of statement of fact and accusation. This brought the survey to a total of 10 categories with 12 examples.

shown in Figure 1. One problem with this method of self-reporting is that many speakers are unaware of their own use of eh. Nonetheless, while the amount of use may be underreported, I believe that the overall results reflect well the patterns of use in this population.
Figure 1: Format of 2004 Toronto Survey Questions
     Please provide the following information about yourself by circling the appropriate responses.
    1. Age range: under 30
2. Sex: male female
30-55 over 55
    3. Is English your first language?
3a. Were you born in Canada?
3b. If not, how many years have you have lived in Canada?
under 2 2-5 6-10 years more than 10
Each of the following sentences illustrate a type of use of eh? For each one you will be asked to indicate whether you have heard eh used in this way. whether you yourself ever use it this way, and what your attitude is to this usage. In assessing your attitude, think of your immediate reaction on hearing this expression. The choices mean:
yes no yes no
                  positive neutral negative
I have a positive feeling about the speaker. I have a neutral feeling about the speaker.
I have a negative feeling about the speaker.
      1. After statements of opinion, like: Nice day, eh? a. Have you heard this type of use? yes
b. Do you use it yourself? never
c. Your attitude to this usage is: positive
no
sometimes often neutral negative
         The respondents were students enrolled in the Introduction to Linguistics course at the University of Toronto. There were 30 males and 61 females who were Canadian born, with English as their first language and under 30 years of age. There were 5 males and 13 females in the recent immigrant group; these respondents were under 30 years of age, had been in Canada 5 years or less and did not have English as their first language.
3. Results: Canadian Born Respondents
The results for recognition of the different types of eh are shown in Table 3; the three expressions with the highest recognition rates are shaded. They are: eh with opinions, eh with exclamations and the expression I know, eh? There is good recognition of all the types of eh presented, with over 50% recognition in each case, ranging up to 100%.
Table 4 shows results for the use of eh. The same three constructions are at the top, appreciably higher than the other uses, which range down to a low of 16% for the narrative eh. The shaded rows are those with differences between male and female use: women use I know, eh? and eh with an exclamation more

4 than men; men report more frequent use of the accusation, statement of fact, and
the imperative Open the window, eh?

   With respect to frequent use, shown in Table 5, the same three types of eh are at the top, but the gap between the most frequently used expression I know, eh? and the following two, has widened. Over 50% of respondents report using I know, eh? frequently. This is almost twice as high as the percentage of respondents reporting frequent use of the next two, the exclamation and opinion. The other types of eh show considerably lower reports of frequent use, with the

5
narrative and imperative at the bottom. The differences seen between men and women in Table 4 are much less evident in these results of frequent use.

  Language attitudes can be difficult to evaluate. The actual content of the example sentences, such as the positive sentiments expressed in Nice day, eh?, might influence the attitude expressed towards the construction itself. The respondents' attitudes to the different constructions are shown in Table 6.

  Not surprisingly, expressions with the most negative ratings are those that

6
are least used and the expressions with the most positive ratings are those most frequently used: narrative and imperative eh elicited the most negative responses and the opinion, exclamation and I know, eh? the most positive. Again there are some differences between the male and female responses, with women showing a higher negative response to the narrative eh and a higher positive response to the exclamation What a game, eh?.
4. Comparison of 2004 Results With Results of Earlier Surveys
Table 7 shows a comparison of the 2004 results with the surveys done in Vancouver and Ottawa. The results for eh from the Ottawa and Vancouver surveys have never been compared before. It can be seen that while they show similar patterns of responses, the overall numbers are much higher for Ottawa than for Vancouver. None of the Vancouver results are higher than 50% whereas more than half of the Ottawa responses are over 50%. This suggests that eh is used more in central Canada than in the west, and the results from Toronto, also in central Canada, are very close to the Ottawa rates. The average of the seven questions common to the surveys are practically identical for Toronto and Ottawa, indicating that usage has remained fairly constant over the last two decades. It should be noted that the Vancouver results in Table 7 may be lower than the actual rates of use, for the authors state that the 'yes' response indicates acceptance, and apparently reflects a grammaticality judgement as well as use.

  The Ottawa survey reported attitude results for only three of the sentences, all described as 'abhorrence'. These are shown in Table 8 along with the results for the 2004 survey. It is not explained how these Ottawa attitudes were collected. The Toronto speakers are apparently less accepting of the pardon eh and interrogative eh that the Ottawa respondents. However; the attitudes towards narrative eh? are strikingly similar in the two surveys, with almost 50% of respondents expressing a negative attitude or abhorrence.

7
The results for student respondents for eh meaning 'pardon' in the 1972 Survey of Canadian English are shown in Table 9, along with the corresponding 2004 results. These results suggest that this use of eh has increased in the past thirty years, even though almost one third of the 2004 respondents rated it negatively (Table 6). The Survey of Canadian English also published results according to province, as shown in Table 10. The results for both questions are quite consistent across the country, with British Columbia as high as the other provinces. This provides support to the suggestion above that the results in the Survey of Vancouver English are lower than actual usage. The results for Quebec are somewhat higher than the rest of the country for eh meaning 'pardon', and have perhaps been influenced by the similar function of the Canadian French hein. The authors comment that the use of eh for 'pardon' "has been cited as distinctively Canadian" (Scargill & Warkentyne: 75); it may be Canadian but the results show that it is used much less than other types of eh.

Table 11 compares the 2004 results with the Love's 1973 results in Edmonton. The responses are very close for the opinion, exclamation and imperative. While the responses differ for the two wh-questions, Love's interrogative has accusatory overtones and shows a close response to the 2004 accusation. Since the responses for eh in Toronto and Edmonton are quite similar, even after a gap of 30 years, one can conclude both that the use of eh is fairly consistent across Canada, as seen with the results in Table 10, and that there has been little change in the use of eh over the course of a generation.

The recognition rates for the small group of recent immigrants are shown in Table 12. When compared with Table 3, it can be seen that, as expected, immigrants have a lower rate of recognition that the native speakers.

Although overall the recognition rates are lower than for the native speakers, there are very high rates of recognition for the opinion and exclamation, in particular. Conversely, there is a surprisingly low recognition rate among new immigrants for I know, eh? considering that 85% of their fellow students claim to use it and over half claim to use it frequently.
Table 13 shows the use of eh by the recent immigrants. Although these students have been in Canada for less than five years, already two-thirds claim to use eh with opinions, 56% use eh with exclamations and 50% use eh for 'pardon'.

   As was noted with recognition rates, the immigrants' usage rates do not reflect the pattern of use they hear from native speakers. This can be seen in Table 14 where the responses of the native Canadian speakers regarding use (Table 4) are compared with the use reported by the new immigrants. On the one hand, immigrant speakers do not seem to be picking up set expressions like Thanks, eh? and I know, eh?. On the other hand, their use of eh for pardon is higher than that of native speakers.
One explanation for the immigrants' different pattern of use might lie in their interpretation of the function of eh. It is possible that the immigrants are interpreting eh as strictly as a question particle, equivalent to tags like 'isn't it' or 'don't you think'. This interpretation of eh is consistent with eh following statements of opinion, accusations or fact; these can all be rephrased as questions, such as Nice day, isn't it? or It goes over here, doesn't it? However, this question particle meaning of eh is not compatible with expressions like Thanks or I know which make no sense when rephrased as questions. This would

10
explain why immigrants are not picking up these expressions as quickly as some of the others , even though they are exposed frequently to them.

  6. Respondents' Comments
Respondents were asked to describe the speaker of sentence10, the narrative eh - This guy is up on the 27th floor, eh? then he gets out on the ledge, eh. . . A fairly consistent picture emerges from these responses: the speaker was perceived to be uneducated, rural, and lower class. That is, the speaker had traits not shared by the respondents, who were educated students at an urban university, most likely of middle class backgrounds. Other characteristics mentioned were: male and Canadian, or, an American trying to imitate a Canadian. It is clear that the narrative eh is considered to be both stereotypically Canadian and highly stigmatized, a fact reflected in the highly negative attitudes assigned to this use.
Several students remarked that eh is not used as often as "some people think" or as often as non-Canadians think Canadians use it. As well, some students noted that they used hey rather than eh in some of the contexts.
7. Conclusions
This survey led to several interesting findings. First, it has been clearly shown that in any discussion of eh it is important to differentiate between the different types of eh. There is a wide range in the rates of recognition and use of the different types of eh and in the attitudes towards towards. Among native Canadian speakers usage ranged from 16% for narrative eh to 85% for I know, eh? Three types of eh were consistently high in recognition, use and positive attitudes: eh with opinions, as in Nice day, eh?, eh with exclamations, as in What

11
a game, eh?, and the expression I know, eh?. It may be that when students protest that they do not use eh very much, they are referring to the stereotypical stigmatized narrative eh, which they indeed do not use very much, and are not considering other more positively viewed and frequently used constructions.
From comparisons with earlier surveys, it can be concluded that the use of eh has not diminished over the past 30 years, and may have even increased with some types of constructions. The 2004 results were very close to the 1980 Ottawa results and the 1973 results from Edmonton. Despite the lower results from Vancouver, the evidence from the cross-Canada Survey of Canadian English and from Love's Edmonton survey suggest that the use of eh is fairly consistent across the country.
Although the typical user of narrative eh was described as male, there is no evidence that men use eh more than women do. The overall rates are very similar, especially with respect to frequent use. There is, however, some variation between the different expressions, with women reporting more use of I know, eh? and eh with exclamations, and men reporting more use of eh with accusations, imperatives and statements of fact.
New immigrants quickly pick up the use of eh, with two-thirds reporting use of eh with opinions after less than five years in Canada. They associate the use of eh with their developing Canadian identity: one speaker, who had been in Canada for less than two years, said, "I was kind of proud when it slipped out of my mouth the first time." Their usage patterns, however, do not consistently reflect those of Canadian born speakers: apparently they do not pick up the set expressions Thanks, eh? and I know, eh? as quickly as other uses of eh. This suggests that new immigrants are interpreting eh as a question particle only.
This study raises many interesting questions for further research. Are there common uses of eh that were missed in this survey? Does the use of eh vary with class and age? Do rural speakers use eh more than urban speakers? Are there variations in usage from coast to coast? Who uses hey instead of eh, and in which contexts? Which uses of eh are specifically Canadian? How has Canadian French hein influenced Canadian eh? How can the function of eh be described? There is still much to learn about the Canadian eh.

The Sounds of the Language: British, North American, Canadian1
R.E. McConnell
It has long been known that the sound system of any language changes, sometimes slowly and imperceptibly, and sometimes within a generation of speakers. A change may start in a large or prestigious centre and then spread outward, leaving the older form only in remote areas, which thus become "relic areas." A change in London speech, for example, often did not reach Ireland, Scotland, or some rural areas in England. Some changes are confined to certain social classes. Others affect the whole sound system of a language, one shift making another one necessary, and then another, and so on. Such a chain effect took place between approximately 1300 and 1700 with all the tense vowels of English, a shift which left the "back" tense vowels (i.e. those made with the back of the tongue raised) quite unstable and the resulting forms in modern English often unpredictable. Do these sets of words, for example, all rhyme in your speech:
Most Canadians would say broom and room with the vowel sound of too, but many Maritimers, like eastern New Englanders, would use the vowel of book for these words and also for roof and hoof. The word soot has at least three variants all across Canada.
Tracing such patterns and variants in pronunciation is one of the most important tasks of dialectologists. Because the sound system is probably that part of the language system that a person uses least consciously, it is therefore a good "marker" of the sources of one's language and the influences upon it.

McConnell is a Professor Emerita in the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia. “The Sounds of the Language” is an excerpt from her 1979 textbook, Our Own Voice: Canadian English and how it is studied (Toronto: Gage) 21-31, 34. Some of the trends in Canadian English that McConnell discusses here have progressed rapidly, for example, the loss of the which/witch distinction. —Eds.

To treat adequately the sound systems that Canadians use and to compare them with other varieties of English would be difficult to do in an introductory book such as this. Nor is everything known about the speech of Canadians. To identify sounds, we will use the symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)—a system in which a given speech sound is consistently represented by the same written or printed symbol. The symbols are enclosed in square brackets to distinguish them from ordinary letters of the alphabet. But we will use the IPA system in a general way only, and we will give (in spite of the obvious room for error on the part of the reader) some key words for identifying the symbols.
Dialectologists use the IPA, but with finer distinctions. They may also use in their questionnaires the devices of rhyming (e.g. "Does genuine rhyme with fine or with fin?") and, of "sames" and "contrasts" (e.g. "Is cot pronounced the same as caught, or differently?" "Is hoarse said the same as horse? Is whine the same as wine?"). These devices may be useful to you if you wish to test some of the items in this section with people in your part of Canada.
North America as a Relic Area: Pronunciation
A few differences in pronunciation immediately mark off most North American speech from nearly all other English dialects. These are certain features of seventeenth and eighteenth century English speech which were retained in most of North America, including Canada, but changed in SSB [Standard Southern British]. Because Australia, New Zealand, and other countries were colonized after the changes in the home country, these phonological differences set North American English apart.
1. So-called broad a
North America (generally) has retained the older [æ] (the vowel of hat) in words such as dance, half, path, pasture, whereas SSB has adopted [a:], somewhat like the vowel in father or that in farm. This use of [a:] was a dialect feature in Great Britain and was considered "vulgar," or
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader
79
 Vowels in English are tense, like the [i] and [u] in feel and fool, or lax, like the [ɪ] and [ʊ] in fill and full. In pronouncing such vowels as [i] and [u], the tenseness can be felt in all the organs of speech, but particularly in the tongue.
What evidence suggests that the writer of these lines is an American, not a Britisher?
The turtle lives 'twixt plated decks Which practically conceal its sex.
I think it clever of the turtle
In such a fix to be so fertile.
—Ogden Nash, Many Long Years Ago (1945).

substandard, up to the end of the eighteenth century, when the fashion rather suddenly changed.
In neither area is the pattern complete. North Americans generally do not use [æ] before [r] in words like far, farm, and dark, nor before [l] in many words, such as palm, nor in some frequently used words such as father. In England, the change did not affect all words: bass (the fish) and mass have [æ] while grass has [a:]; the newer word plastic has [æ] but plaster has [a:]. As English pop singers of imported American lyrics have discovered, dance and romance do not rhyme in SSB. Many an imitation of southern British speech puts an [a:] into words that do not have it, e.g. gather, which should have [æ] and does not rhyme with rather.
Here (in Table 1) are the results of one question in the Survey of Canadian English (SCE), a written questionnaire (1972) given to Grade 9 students and their parents across Canada. The results shown are in percentages and are for students and parents born in Canada. Examine the results. Can you explain the regional differences?

2. Loss of r
North America has retained the post-vocalic [r] (that is, [r] after a vowel) before a consonant as in farm and court or before a pause (i.e. in final position, as in far and core), whereas SSB has dropped the [r], so that far, for example, sounds to Canadians like fah [fa:]. There is abundant evidence that in Elizabethan English all dialects articulated r in all positions. The dropping of [r] in the positions mentioned was an innovation in SSB, completed by the end of the eighteenth century. The change also affected certain areas of the United States, especially eastern New England and parts of the South. These areas, which kept closer contact with the mother country, either changed to the British pattern or were settled by people from the southern and eastern counties of England, where the r change (and in some cases the "broad a" change) may already have taken place before these settlers emigrated. The Midland area of the United States was settled by many Ulster Scotch- Irish people, who kept a strong final [r]. The Scots and Irish influence has also been strong in Canada.
It is interesting to note how many r-less variants have crept into dialects of English—some seeming substandard or perhaps folksy even though the r-less varieties of English enjoy a certain prestige. Here are some examples: cuss (a variant of curse), gal (girl), hoss (horse), bust (burst).
3. A Relic Stress Pattern
North American speech usually retains a seventeenth-century stress pattern in many polysyllabic words, a pattern probably used by Shakespeare but since changed in SSB. The difference is especially noticeable in words ending in -ary, -ery, and -ory. North Americans use a secondary stress on the second from last syllable, while the British tendency is to keep the strong stress on the first syllable but to reduce the other syllables, thereby changing the sound of each vowel to a schwa or omitting it altogether.
81
 How do these two fairly recent changes in SSB—the change to "broad a" [a] and the loss of [r] in certain positions—explain why speakers of SSB say calves and carves as homophones [pronounce them the same way], while most North Americans do not?
In any variety of English, all vowels are affected in quality when followed by r, and both British and North American dialects display a bewildering variety of pronunciations for certain words. Listen,
for example, to various dialect speakers say car, poor, pure, clerk, bear, more, and the surname Moore.
Schwa, also called the "neutral vowel" and represented by [ǝ] in IPA, refers to the unstressed vowel sound heard, for example, in the first syllable of above and the last syllable of circus.
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader

Some examples are:
U.S.A.
secretary millinery obligatory monastery
British
sécretary (as if sécret’ry) millinery (as if millin'ry) obligatory (as if obligat'ry) mónastery (as if mónast’ry)
Some other words show similar differences. For example: interèsting interesting (as if int'risting)
medicine médicine; (as if médsin)
For some words, American dictionaries record both pronunciations—the British one often being assumed to be the more elegant. It is also apparent that the North American stress pattern (and perhaps the influence of the spelling) may be affecting British speech; the pronunciation sécretàry, for example, is now commonly heard in England. Canadians choose from both these major patterns of stress placement but, like Americans, tend to follow the older pattern. This major difference in stress placement gives the two large varieties of English markedly different speech rhythms.
A recent change in British speech is the converse of the movement described above. The main stress in some four- and five-syllable words in British speech is now moving from the initial syllable to the second or third syllable. Simeon Potter (1969) notes that labóratory has replaced the former Cambridge pronunciation láboratory, that kilómetre is competing with kilometre, and contróversy is gaining upon cóntroversy. He observes that in many four-syllable words such as applicable, commendable, comparable, despicable, formidable, illustrative, intricacy, migratory, pejorative, and reputable, usage remains unsettled; but he decides that the initial stress still "bears the cachet of elegance" and, even in England, will probably prevail.
Within Britain, the United States, and Canada, there are many other slight variations of stress, and thus of pronunciation of vowels; some of these variations are social in range and some are regional. Little wonder that Canadians, who are exposed to many kinds of English, often consult dictionaries to find out the "correct" placement of stress in words such as centenary, compensatory, or predicative, or to see if other Canadians' final vowel in program or record (noun) is more "correct" than their own—only to discover
The Sounds of the Language, R. E. McConnell
82

that more than one pattern is acceptable. How do you pronounce dictionary? territory? cemetery? necessary? Do you give the full vowel sound to the second from last syllable? Do you say ['progræm] or ['progrəm]? ['rekɔrd] or [rekərd]?
4. Intonation Differences
Few people realize that the intonations of a language or dialect, the musical aspects of speech, marked by the raising and lowering of pitch, carry a great deal of message. In fact, intonation is so highly patterned and so basic within a language—and even within a dialect of a language—that a good mimic wishing to copy a language or dialect learns the intonation patterns as the first, and perhaps the most important, step. Because we frequently tie emotional meanings to changes in intonation, misunderstandings can occur with unfamiliar patterns. The main intonational difference between the two large varieties of English— British and North American—shows itself in the question or request pattern.
Generally, the North American intonation for a question or request demanding a yes/no answer is a long, continuous rise in pitch. The British pattern begins at a high pitch, then falls, and rises again on the last syllables only. A recent study of the intonations used by Toronto teenagers, however, shows that many variations exist, some related to the sex and class differences of the speakers—enough differences to suggest that more research must be done before generalizations may be made about Canadian speech (C. Seguinot, in P. R. Léon and P. Martin 1976). There may also be subtle differences between and within regional areas of Canada. If, for instance, we say that prairie speech is "flatter" than Ontario speech, what exactly do we mean? Is Maritime intonation different again? In what way?
83
 In Robertson Davies' novel Fifth Business (1970), set in a small town of Ontario about a generation ago, one character (a Canadian) expresses his emotional reaction to a word pronounced with a different stress. (How do you pronounce the word?)
I used to hear him abused by some of the junior masters at the school. They were Englishmen or Canadians who had studied in England, and they were full of the wisdom of the London School of Economics and the doctrines of The New Statesman. . . . it amused me to hear those poor fellows, working for terrible salaries, denouncing Boy and a handful of others as "ca-pittle- ists"; they always stressed the middle syllables, this being a fashionable pronunciation of the period, and one that seemed to make rich men especially con- temptible.
Try taping various speakers saying this question, including British speakers if possible.
"Would you mind repeating that?"
The intonation pattern that many British speakers use to mean merely "Please repeat that" often suggests anger or disbelief to North Americans.
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader

Canada as a Relic Area: A Canadian Diphthong Rule
Canadian English differs from most British and American dialects in the pronunciation of two diphthongs. In fact, the two variations can be seen as one systematic "sound rule." A diphthong is the blending of two different vowels into one syllabic unit, so that the native speaker hears one vowel sound; examples are the "ou" sound in house and how, the "oy" of boy and toil, and the "ay" of die and tile. Say them very slowly and you can hear the gliding from one vowel sound to another.
Nearly every non-Canadian notices the way in which Canadians pronunce the "ou" sound in words such as house, out, shout, and south. The diphthong is not [aʊ] as in most other dialects but [ʌʊ]; that is, it begins with, not the vowel sound of father or balm, but a centralized vowel (i.e. made more in the central part of the mouth) like the [ʌ] in love, or a stressed form of the [ə] at the beginning of above.
Similar, though less noticeable, is the Canadian diphthong in such words as white, life, type , and mice. It follows the same pattern in that it is pronounced [ʌ], with a centralized first vowel, rather than the southern British and the American [a] with a glide from the vowel sound of cart to that of—approximately—sit [st].
Yet in words such as how, houses, housing, rowdy, loud, and wide, alive, tidy, knives, and high, Canadians regularly use the diphthongs [aʊ] and [a], as do speakers of the other two major varieties of English. What, then, is this system that Canadians are unconsciously using?
A Canadian can hear the different diphthongs in pairs such as the following. (Caution: don't let the spelling fool you; listen to the sound of the vowel before voiced or voiceless consonants. You can also feel the change in the opening of your mouth.)
84
 The Rule: The first part of each diphthong becomes centralized [Chambers, this volume, calls this shift “raising”] before a voiceless consonant.
knives: knife hide: height rise: rice loud: lout lousy: louse how: house
voiced voiceless
[v] [f] [d] [t] [z] [s] [d] [t] [z] [s] zero [s]
The Sounds of the Language, R. E. McConnell

A voiced sound is one in which the cords vibrate; a voiceless sound is articulated without this vibration. You can hear the difference by covering your ears and articulating [z] (voiced) and [s] (voiceless). Vowels are regularly voiced. The difference is important in the phonological system of the English language, in which there is a meaningful contrast between the members of such pairs as [b]-[p]; [z]-[s]; [g]-[k];[v]- [f]; [d]-[t]; and [ð]-[ θ] (e.g. breathe/breath).
The general English language often marks a switch from noun to verb by voicing the final consonants; when this happens, Canadians also change their diphthongs.
noun (voiceless) my house [hʌʊs]
verb (voiced)
I'll house them for a week [haʊz]. Don't mouth your words [maʊð].
When words are run together, a diphthong may follow the same rule. Canadians usually say high (alone) or Hi! with the [a] sound, but in high school (fused, or pronounced as if one word) they probably switch to the [ʌ] diphthong (before the voiceless [s]).
Many Canadians use the regular [a] when pronouncing diaper with three syllables, ['daəpər] as the diphthong is before a vowel, i.e. a voiced sound; yet they change to [ʌ] if they drop a syllable, ['dʌpər] (as if rhyming with viper or wiper ), because the diphthong now is followed by a voiceless consonant, [p].
Unconsciously, Canadians are following a complicated yet systematic rule.
Where did this feature of Canadian pronunciation come from? There is evidence to show that in Shakespeare's time—the period in which the first British settlers came to North America—all the front glide diphthongs were pronounced [ʌ]. Though probably already changing in the seventeenth century, [aʊ] was also an early pronunciation of the back glide diphthong in all positions. Dialect surveys reveal that scattered instances of these earlier centralized pronunciations still occur in rural parts of New England and in some parts of western New York State. Only in three widely separated areas in North America, however, does the systematic alternation of the diphthongs occur: in Canada and (with some slight differences) in eastern Virginia and a part of South Carolina.
Therefore the [ʌʊ] of out and house and the [ʌ] of white and ice in Canadian speech are probably relics, reflecting an earlier stage in English pronunciation. These relic
my mouth [mʌʊθ]
Plurals, too, follow a similar pattern, as in wife: wives, house: houses, when these also
involve voicing.
Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader
85

features are retained only partially (that is, before voiceless consonants), but systematically.
How Do You Pronounce "khaki"?
One unique Canadian pronunciation illustrates what can happen when a people conscious of their British and North American linguistic backgrounds borrow a word—in this case, the word khaki (from India, the Urdu word for 'dust'). Involved are both the loss of [r], and the [a] versus [æ] difference.
The English pronounce the word as [ka:'ki] (that is, no [r]); the Americans use a spelling pronunciation, with [æ], rhyming with tacky. Canadians probably first heard the word through Britishers and, accustomed to the Englishman's omission of r before consonants, inserted an r sound, and made the word ['kar ki] (to rhyme with how a Canadian says snarky). . . . At present, with less frequent use of the word khaki and with the power of mass media from the United States, there is a movement toward the American pronunciation—that is, if younger people know the word at all. The results of recent surveys suggest that few of them do.
How Do You Pronounce "tomato"?
Sometimes a prestige pronunciation extends to one or two words only. In aunt, rather, and tomato, for example, the [æ] may give way to the British sound [a:]. In fact, tomato may have three variations: the vowels of hate, hot, and hat. A survey of the Kootenay area in British Columbia showed definite trends away from the British forms.

Practical Observations
One can train the ear to tune in to Canadian speech, and one can also listen for some
The Sounds of the Language, R. E. McConnell
86
 
sound changes that are happening right now. 1. How Canadians treat t
(a) In-many parts of Canada and the United States, a t sound in certain positions may be voiced to a d or to almost a d. Listen to how people around you, in ordinary running speech, say
butter (like budder?)
kitty (like kiddy?)
patio (like padio?)
teeter-totter (like teeder-todder?)
If asked to pronounce pairs, e.g. bleating/bleeding, better/ bedder, waiting/wading, and the like, such speakers can readily put back the t; but in unconscious, informal speech the movement toward or actually to the d can be heard. . . .
Listen to how Canadians pronounce Ottawa.
This voicing of the t is not "sloppy speech"; it dates back to Elizabethan English or earlier, and is heard also in some dialects of Anglo-Irish and southern English (other relic areas for this sound feature). The spreading of this voicing in North America has been observed and recorded since the late nineteenth century.
(b). Also widespread in Canada and the United States is the deletion of a t in certain positions, especially after an n, so that winter sounds like (or almost like) winner, centre like cenner, twenty like twenny, international like innernational, and interested like innerested.
Speakers can—as in (a) above—recapture the t in conscious or formal speech as, for example, in differentiating between meanings of an inter-city express and an inner city express, but the deletion is becoming increasingly noticeable in Canada. A Canadian television ad about a dental product insists that the product was "invenid by a denist."
(c) On the other hand, an intrusive t may occur between 1 or n and s—that is, in the sequences ls or ns—so that else, for example, may be pronounced likes elts, and once may sound like wunts. This explains why dance is sometimes spelled dants.
2. Mary merry marry
Do you and the people in your area say all these words in the same way?
Speakers of SSB and of most other British dialects have three distinct vowels in these
87
 Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader

words. Many older Canadians say Mary and merry in the same way but marry differently. Dialectologists are finding, however, that
many younger Canadians are merging these vowel
sounds before r (when the r comes between two sounded
vowels) so that all three words sound alike. This change, which happened long ago in the northern and north midland parts of the United States, is now taking place in many parts of North America.
Try testing this item in your area, and see if there is a generation gap, or if the change has already occurred.
Some Other General Patterns in Canadian Speech Sounds
1. cot/caught, don/dawn, collar/caller, holler/hauler
Are these pairs homophones for you (that is, do they sound exactly alike)? Most Canadians have merged these two vowels sounds, which SSB speakers and many (but not all) Americans differentiate.
2. horse/hoarse, morning/mourning
Are these pairs homophones for you? They are pronounced alike in most parts of North America. But in many parts of the English-speaking world, including the American South, parts of the Midlands, sections of New England and, possibly, parts of the Canadian Maritimes, these words are clearly differentiated, as are the vowels of forty and four. To know this is to understand why the spelling differentiation is sensible for many English speakers.
Some Other Divided Usages in Canadian Pronunciation.
The speech forms of all three large regions—the British Isles, the United States, and Canada—have within them a wide variety of vowel patterns besides the main differences mentioned above. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that Canadian speech sometimes follows a dominant American pattern (especially northern), some- times the British (SSB) usage, sometimes a mixed pattern, and sometimes its own. Here are some of the main variations:
1. Are the following pairs homophones in your speech? (Do not be fooled by the spellings!)
88
 Barry
berry
bury
Do you differentiate these in speech?
The Sounds of the Language, R. E. McConnell

wine/whine, witch/which, Wales/whales, weather/whether, wear/where.
Few speakers of SSB now distinguish between members of these pairs. The older use of [hw] to begin which, whale, and so on is now considered old-fashioned or provincial. This change in SSB came about in the late eighteenth century.
In the United States, usage varies: the New England area is evenly divided in usage, but the northern area overwhelmingly keeps the older pattern.
Surveys in Canada show that the pattern is unsettled, some Canadians using [hw] consistently, some using only [w], and others using either—depending on the stress or on the word. For example, a Canadian may differentiate between weather and whether, yet pronounce Wales and whales as homophones and use either [w] or [hw] for wheat or wheel. Sometimes teachers have insisted upon different pronunciations to match the spellings, resulting in people either thinking they differentiate the sounds or differentiating only a few pairs of words.
How many of these words do you differentiate in speech? where wear were Listen to how Canadians pronounce Ottawa.
2. Are these words homophones in your speech: do, due, dew?
In both the United States and Canada, the pronunciation of the vowel in words such as student, news, tune, and duke has long been a speech marker and a social shibboleth. The British generally use a glide (that is, a sound beginning like the y of yes or the ee of see, followed by the u sound), especially after t, d and n: this pronunciation, as contrasted with the simple [u] usually found in educated North American, carries much prestige. Surveys of educated people in Ontario show wide individual variation and much inconsistency. Listen carefully to the usage in your area, especially in words like Tuesday, news, dew, duke, due, tune, student, and suit.
3. How do you pronounce the italicized syllable in these patterns? Are you consistent within a pattern?
(a) pro cess; pro gress (noun, verb) pro duce (noun, verb) pro fane; pro ceeds
(b) agile docile facile fertile futile hostile missile textile virile sterile servile puerile fragile reptile
It is interesting that, although Americans tend to weaken or even eliminate the vowel of the -ile while SSB speakers keep it (so that the example words all rhyme with mile), American speakers usually keep it in gentile, exile, crocodile, and domicile. Canadians
89
 Canadian English: A Linguistic Reader

have mixed usage, often rhyming most such words with mile, but perhaps using the American pronunciation for a few words, such as missile or futile.

Here is how some modern dictionaries describe the pronunciations: AHD is The American Heritage Dictionary, 1969-70; OALD is Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English, 3rd ed., 1974; DCE is Dictionary of Canadian English (1967 or 1973). The three possible pronunciations are -in (rhyming with fin), -ine (rhyming with fine), and -een (rhyming with teen).

   Variations occur in all regions. The pronunciation of genuine with the last syllable rhyming with nine is widespread in Canada, but is considered by many to be vulgar. Walter S. Avis (1973) points out how persistent this attitude has been in Canada:
That this shibboleth has a long history in Canada may be inferred from the following bit of doggerel reported by Captain Marryat, an English traveler, in his Diary in America, London, 1839 (Vol. 1. p. 217):
To the Ladies of the City of Toronto [1837].
Our ladies are the best kind,
Of all others the most fine;
In their manners and their minds, Most refined and genuine.
Avis comments: The italics of the last word reflect the attitude of Marryat toward this sample of Torontoese. I personally see no reason whatever for disowning this pronunciation, especially in view of its obvious acceptance by a substantial number of educated Canadians.
This pronunciation is also heard in the Midland area of the United States. Here are the relevant results of the SCE (1972). What differences do you see?

  Question 26 in Scargill’s Survey of Canadian English
What is your own attitude toward the pronunciation of this word? 4. anti- semi- multi-
Most Americans use ['semai] (ending with the vowel of my ); Canadians generally prefer ['semi] (ending with the vowel of me), though the other form is also heard. The two other prefixes follow the same pattern.
Avis reported in 1956 that Ontario teenagers, noticing the pronunciation south of the border, referred to Americans as "the semi's" ['semaiz]. . . .
Conclusions
Canadian speech in general is much the same as that of the Northern dialect area of the United States, particularly in its use of [æ] in dance, class, and the like and in its strong final and preconsonantal r. But it also has many Midland American features, many British features, and some features of its own. Its varied settlement history and its ties with the British Isles make inevitable many divided usages, and there is a broad tolerance of such differences. Nevertheless, there does seem to be emerging something like an educated Standard Canadian English, with a grouping of features and choices that marks it as being Canadian. Slowly dialectologists are finding out the Canadian choices.
